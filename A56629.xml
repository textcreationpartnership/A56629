            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>THIS Book had the Name of DEUTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RONOMY given it by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> from the principal Scope and Deſign of it; which was to repeat unto the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> before he left them, the <hi>chief Laws of God,</hi> which had been given them: that they who were not then born when they were firſt delivered, or were uncapable to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, or had not ſufficiently regarded them, might be inſtructed in them, and awakned to attend to them. See <hi>v.</hi> 1. &amp; 5. In order to this he premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a ſhort Narrative, of what had befaln them ſince they came from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> unto this time; in the <hi>three</hi> firſt Chapters: And then in the <hi>fourth</hi> urges them by a moſt pathetical Exhortation, to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64710:5"/>
of thoſe Laws, which he had taught them; eſpecially the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> with which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the <hi>fifth</hi> Chapter. Where he makes a ſolemn Rehearſal of the Covenant God made with them in <hi>Horeb;</hi> and what immediately followed upon the delivery of the Law by God himſelf, from Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> And then, having earneſtly preſſed the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>first Commandment,</hi> in the former part of the <hi>ſixth</hi> Chapter; and in the latter part of it, and in ſeveral Chapters that follow (to the end of the <hi>eleventh)</hi> reminded them of a great many things which God had done for them, and given them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Cautions, leſt they let them ſlip out of their Minds, and uſed many Arguments from ſeveral To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks (as we call them) to move them to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to all the other Commandments: he proceeds in the <hi>twelfth</hi> Chapter, and ſo forward to the <hi>twenty eighth,</hi> to remember them of a great many other Laws beſides the Ten Commandments, which he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them. Some of which he explains; others he inforces with further Reaſons; and in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces adds new Laws, for the greater Security of the whole, (particularly, he orders the writing of God's Law upon Stones, when they came into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Chapter XXVII.) And then pronounces thoſe Promiſes, which God had made to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and his Threatnings to the Diſobedient; more largely, and with greater force, then he had done in the XXVI<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Leviticus.</hi> After which he again remembers them of ſeveral wonderful Works of God for them, (Chapter XXIX.) and renews the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between God and them; uſing ſeveral Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſwade them to a dutiful obſervance of God's Law: Which he commands (Chapter XXXI.)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64710:5"/>
to be read to all the People, in the concluſion of every Seventh Year; that none might pretend igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it. And then concludes all with a moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Song, which he orders every one to learn; and with a Bleſſing upon the Twelve Tribes.</p>
               <p>All this was done in the two laſt Months, of the laſt Year of <hi>Moſes</hi> his life. But not all at once; as plainly appears by ſeveral parts of the Book: in which he writes what he delivered to them, at ſeveral times. Which is the reaſon of the Repetition of the very ſame thing, over and over again: that he might make it ſink into their Minds, by being often inculcated. Some have been ſo fooliſh, as to make this an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt this Book being compoſed by <hi>Moſes.</hi> But it ſhows their great ignorance; all wiſe Men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ever judged it neceſſary to ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the very ſame things, concerning the ſame things; that they might be thoroughly underſtood, and fixed in the memory of their Auditors, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in their Hearts and Affections. Particularly <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctetus</hi> (as <hi>David Chytraeus</hi> long ago obſerved) deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this as a profitable Rule in all Studies; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>This must be known,</hi> as a certain Truth, <hi>that it is not eaſie for a Man to attain the ſolid knowledge of any thing, unleſs he both read and hear the ſame things every day; and alſo ſet himſelf to the practice of them.</hi> This Courſe <hi>Moſes</hi> took with the Children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> ſpending every day, it is likely, of the latter end of his life, in calling to their mind, again and again, what he had taught them; and the reaſon they had to do accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64710:6"/>Verſe 1. <hi>THeſe be the words.]</hi> This Book contains the words</p>

                  <hi>Which Moſes ſpake unto all Iſrael.]</hi> All the People could not hear what he ſaid, but he ordered the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Heads of the ſeveral Tribes, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the whole Congregation what he delivered to them, in the Audience of many of the People who were aſſembled with them. Thus theſe words are commonly underſtood. But conſidering the great weight of what is here ſaid, I rather think that <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, at ſeveral times, ſpake what here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, in the Ears of the People. See V. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On this ſide Jordan.]</hi> The Vulgar <hi>Latin</hi> having tranſlated the Hebrew words <hi>[beeber] on the other ſide Jordan,</hi> it hath furniſhed ſome ill diſpoſed Minds with an Argument, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not the Author of this Book: For he that wrote plainly ſhows that he was in <hi>Canaan,</hi> when he wrote it. But a very little conſideration would have prevented this frivolous Objection; there being nothing more certain, than that the Hebrew words ſignifie indifferently, either one ſide or the other; and may be literally tranſlated, <hi>in the paſſage over Jordan,</hi> or as they were about to paſs over it; as <hi>Huetius</hi> obſerves and proves by plain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> have no other word to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their mind, when they would ſay either on this ſide or beyond. See <hi>Demonſtr. Evang. Propoſ.</hi> IV. <hi>Cap.</hi> XIV. To which another learned Writer ſince him <hi>(Hermannus Witſius, Lib.</hi> I. <hi>Miſcel. Sacr. Cap.</hi> XIV.) hath added ſeveral other places which evidently ſhow that <hi>beeber</hi> is a word, that indifferently belongs to either ſide of any place, (See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> XIV. 40.) and muſt be determined, by the Matter in hand, to which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64710:6"/>
it is to be applied. And here undoubtedly it is to be rendered <hi>on this ſide Jordan.</hi> See III. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Wilderneſs in the Plain.]</hi> In the Plain of <hi>Moab,</hi> where they had remained a long while; as appears from the foregoing Book, XXII <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. XXVI. 3, 63. XXXI. 12. XXXIII. 48, 49. XXXV. 1. XXXVI. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Over against the Red Sea.]</hi> There is no word in the Hebrew Text for <hi>Sea;</hi> and therefore the Marginal Tranſlation is to be preferred, which is, <hi>over against Suph:</hi> which was a place in the Country of <hi>Moab,</hi> (See XXI <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.) over againſt which they now lay encamped; but were ſo far diſtant from the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> that there can be no reſpect to it here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Between Paran.]</hi> He doth not mean the <hi>Wilderneſs of Paran,</hi> frequently mentioned in the foregoing Book (for that was as remote from hence, as the Red Sea) but ſome place in the Country of <hi>Moab;</hi> as <hi>Zuph</hi> was, and the reſt of the places which here follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Diza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah.]</hi> There was a place called <hi>Hazeroth,</hi> where they had encamped a long time ago, XI <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. XXXIII. 17. but it was in another Wilderneſs far from this place, as appears by the account <hi>Moſes</hi> gives of their Removals from that place to this where they now lay, XXXIII <hi>Numb.</hi> 17, 48, 49. And therefore I take this, and the other three places here mentioned, to have been frontier Towns in the Country of <hi>Moab,</hi> which lay upon the borders of this Plain. The laſt of which, <hi>Dizabah,</hi> is tranſlated by the LXX. and the Vulgar, as if it ſignified a place where there were Mines of Gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Onkelos</hi> and the <hi>Hieruſalem Targum,</hi> who take <hi>Suph</hi> to ſignifie the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and <hi>Paran</hi> for the Wilderneſs
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64710:7"/>
through which they had come many years ago, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are forced to add ſeveral words to make out the ſenſe of this Verſe, in this manner; <hi>Theſe be the words which</hi> Moſes <hi>ſpake unto all</hi> Iſrael <hi>on this ſide</hi> Jordan, <hi>&amp;c. reproving them becauſe they ſinned in the Deſert, and provoked God in the Plain over against the Red Sea; and murmured in</hi> Paran, <hi>about Manna; and at</hi> Haze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth <hi>for Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo they proceed to mention other Sins committed in other places; but not in theſe here named: which they force from their natural ſenſe, to comply with this Conceit.</p>

Who, that they might be ſatisfied what a vaſt Man <hi>Og</hi> was, he left it upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord how large his Bedſtead was, and where it might be ſeen; whereby they might judge of his Stature. Beſides, there were in the preſent Generation, great numbers of Children, old Men, Women and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who could not go to ſee <hi>Og</hi> lye at length up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Field: but by this means were inſtructed, from what a terrible Enemy God had delivered them.</p>

Thus the moſt learned Dr. <hi>Alix</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, in his <hi>Reflections upon the four last Books of</hi> Moſes, <hi>p.</hi> 144.

Both which were ſo provided for by the Divine Laws among the Jews, that no Nation could compare with them, or
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64710:35"/>
was really ſo great as they were: For though their Country was but ſmall, and they were often oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſeveral cruel Enemies, who deſired their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation; yet they recovered themſelves, and kept their Laws in their worſt Condition (when common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they beſt obſerved them:) Inſomuch, that as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry learned Perſon of our own Church, long ago, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: After ſo many Changes and Alterations as there were in their State, from better to worſe, and back again; after ſo many Victories got by them over others, and ſo many Captivities of their Perſons, and Deſolations of their Country, as others had wrought, <hi>they continued ſtill one and the ſame People,</hi> governed by the ſame Laws, under ſeveral great and potent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies.

                  <hi>Abraham:</hi> From whence we cannot but learn, that they had an obſcure Notion of the Bleſſed Trinity; and that the Apoſtles uſed no other Language about it, than what was among the Jews. The beſt of which are ſo ſenſible of ſuch things as I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they think we Chriſtians are not <hi>Idolaters,</hi> tho' we believe Three Perſons in the Godhead, (which they fancy inclines to <hi>Polytheiſm</hi>) becauſe we believe the Unity of God; and therefore may be ſaved as well as they. So <hi>J. Wagenſeil</hi> ſhews in his Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon <hi>Sota, Cap.</hi> VII. <hi>p.</hi> 751, &amp;c.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>5</label> all thine Heart,</hi> &amp;c.] Our bleſſed Saviour alledging theſe two Verſes, XII <hi>Mark</hi> 29, 50. looks upon theſe Words, as a part of the Firſt Commandment: For after he had ſaid, <hi>The firſt of all the Commandments is, Hear, O Iſrael, the LORD our God is one LORD; and thou ſhalt love the LORD thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul,</hi> &amp;c. he thus concludes, <hi>This is the first Commandment.</hi> For to own him to be the only God, the Author of our being, and of all things, doth neceſſarily include in it a love of him above all things whatſoever; which requires us to love him, who hath made them ſo lovely. This is another Principle or Spring of Obedience, inſeparable from the Fear of God before-mentioned: Which doth not drive us away from him, but draw us to him; being ſuch a Reverence towards him as Children have to their kind Parents, which is ever mixed with Love to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With all thine Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Might.]</hi> For there being no other God but he alone, none elſe could have any Right to their Love

and Service, but he only: Whoſe Nature is ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that it requires the utmoſt we can do, to teſtifie our regard to him. This one of the Jewiſh Writers hath admirably expreſſed in this manner: <q>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſerves God out of love, he gives himſelf to the Study of his Laws, and unto Good Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which excite him to love God with the moſt fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Affection; not for the ſake of any thing in this World, nor for the fear of any Evil; but he ſerves God truly, becauſe he is the Truth, and the chiefeſt Good; that he may be admitted to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him. And a Man ought to love him with the moſt vehement and intenſe Affection; ſo that he languiſh with love to him, juſt as a Man that is in love with one he deſires to make his Wife: Whereſoever he is, at home or abroad, when he eats and drinks, when he lies down and riſes up, he thinks of her. To which <hi>Solomon</hi> compares the Love of the Spouſe, who ſaith, <hi>I am ſick of Love,</hi> 2 Cant. 5. To this purpoſe, <hi>Baal Chaſidim,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Wagenſeil,</hi> upon <hi>Sota,</hi> Cap. V. p. 611.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>Heart</hi> may be here meant the Will, which is the Original of all that a Man doth, (as the Jews ſpeak) whether Good or Evil: By the <hi>Soul,</hi> the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, (to which St. <hi>Mark</hi> adds the <hi>Mind,</hi> i. e. the Underſtanding, or Rational Faculty) and by <hi>Might</hi> or <hi>Strength,</hi> is meant the Power of the Body for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; which four all together make up the whole Man. And the word ALL added to each of theſe, doth not exclude all other things from any ſhare in our Thoughts and Affections; but only from an equal Intereſt in them. The Love of God ought to be ſuperiour, and direct all our other Motions to ſerve him, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> expreſſes it in his Preface to <hi>Pirke Avoth.</hi>

                  <hi>To bear the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD.]</hi> Here are <hi>three</hi> parts of their Office mentioned, in theſe and the following words. The firſt of which was to carry the Ark; which peculiarly belonged to the <hi>Kohathites,</hi> (III <hi>Numb.</hi> 27, 31.) when the Camp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from one place to another. Who were good Witneſſes that the ſame Ark ſtill remained at that day, wherein <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt placed the Tables of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; for it never ſtirred but by their means.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To ſtand before the LORD.]</hi> This is a Phraſe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Servants that wait upon their Maſters, before whom they are ſaid to ſtand. Thus <hi>Gehazi</hi> attended the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> V. 25. And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets tnemſelves are thus ſaid to ſtand before the LORD, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> XVII. 1. XVIII. 15. Therefore here ſignifies that the <hi>Levites</hi> were ſeparated to be God's Miniſters, as it follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To miniſter unto him.]</hi> As Aſſiſtants to the Prieſts in the Tabernacle, III <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. and as a guard to the Tabernacle, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. Which was the ſecond part of their Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And to bleſs in his Name, unto this day.]</hi> This was the greateſt thing of all, and was peculiar to the Prieſts; who were a part of the Tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> but had the ſole Priviledge among them to bleſs in the Name of the Lord, as we read expreſly, VI <hi>Numb.</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:64710:79"/>
23, 24. If indeed it could be made out, that by <hi>bleſſing in the Name of the LORD,</hi> is meant only to <hi>bleſs the Name of the LORD;</hi> that was common to all the <hi>Levites,</hi> who ſang Praiſes and gave Thanks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to him in the Temple, as I ſuppoſe they did in the Tabernacle. But I find no Example of the uſe of this Expreſſion in this ſence. And therefore it muſt be reſtrained to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who were Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> as well as the reſt; and are ſo called when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> mentions this part of their Office, XXI <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.</p>

But to what he ſaid at the Concluſion of their Removals from place to place, (ſome of which he mentions here, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7.) for then he orders them what to do when they entred into <hi>Canaan,</hi> which, he ſaith, <hi>I have given you to poſſeſs it,</hi> XXXIII <hi>Numb.</hi> 51, 52, 53.</p>

moſt Sacred Solemnities, they were wont to preſent the gods whom they worſhipped, with a Crown or Garland made of the Boughs and Leaves of ſuch Trees, in which they were thought to delight: As to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> a Crown of Oak; to <hi>Apollo</hi> of Laurel; to <hi>Minerva</hi> of Olive; to <hi>Venus</hi> of Myrtle; to <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> of Ivy; to <hi>Rhea, Pan, Neptune</hi> and <hi>Vulcan</hi> of Pine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Ezek.

                  <hi>And deſtroy the Names of them out of that place.]</hi> From this and ſuch like places, the Jews have framed this Affirmative Precept, That <hi>the Gentile Idolatry is by all means to be deſtroyed.</hi> For theſe Nations ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forfeited their Land by their abominable wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and God having beſtowed it upon the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> (whom he took for his peculiar People, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom he dwelt, and therefore calls this <hi>his Land,</hi> See VII. 6.) He, as the King of the Country, might enjoyn what Orders he pleaſed to have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And it was of the higheſt concernment, that there ſhould not be the leaſt footſtep of the old Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry left in the Country: but that he who was the Lord of it, and the LORD of Heaven and Earth,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64710:91"/>
ſhould be alone acknowledged and worſhipped. And there was greater Reaſon for this, than at firſt ſight may be imagined: For as the Hoſt of Heaven was worſhipped, as the glorious Bodies wherein their gods inhabited, (which was the Notion of the beſt of the Heathen for this Worſhip) ſo their <hi>Daemons</hi> were ſuppoſed to dwell in the <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Pillars</hi> which for that end were erected to them. The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Caeleſtial Gods being worſhipped in the Sun, Moon and Stars, wherein they were thought to dwell: and theſe petty Deities, the <hi>Daemons</hi> were worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Images and Columns; which were made for them, and for no other Deities: as our Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> obſerves, <hi>P.</hi> I. <hi>pag.</hi> 778.</p>

Which appears to be the ſence, both from the foregoing words, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. and from the following oppoſition in the next Verſe. And it is very probable, that during their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the Wilderneſs, none Sacrificed in High Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but offered all at the Door of the Tabernacle, which was not far from them. When they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and were many of them at a diſtance from the Tabernacle, they did Sacrifice in High Places; and we do not find them reproved for it, while they worſhipped the LORD alone, and had Prieſts who officiated there, and in other places, according to the Precepts of the Law. But when the Temple was built, and the Ark of God's Preſence no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from place to place, the Prophets required them not to Sacrifice any longer in High Places, nor any where elſe, but only at the Temple. And they blamed even good Kings for not taking away the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64710:91"/>
High Places; though no Sacrifices were offered upon them to any ſtrange god, but to the true God alone. Which Connivance proved, in time, a great Miſchief; for here they firſt began to worſhip ſtrange gods; the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being very prone to chuſe Mountains, and ſuch ſhady places (as the reſt of the World did) wherein to ſet up their Images, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> XVII. 10, 11.

For otherwiſe he would have reſted content with that way of worſhipping God, which the Law had preſcribed.

For God cannot contradict himſelf, nor do any thing to perſwade Men to forſake him, and give his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to another. This ſhows that he ſtill purſues his intention (in this <hi>Chapter</hi> as well as all the foregoing) to eſtabliſh them in the Belief and Worſhip of one God, according to the firſt Commandment. From which nothing was more likely to ſeduce them, than falſe Prophets; who were the great Inſtruments of eſtabliſhing the fouleſt Idolatry in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> As appears from 1 <hi>Kings</hi> XVIII. 19. where we read of no leſs then Four hundred Prophets of <hi>Baal;</hi> and Four hundred and fifty Prophets of the <hi>Groves:</hi> that is, of other falſe gods, particularly <hi>Aſtarte,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> conjectures in his <hi>Syntagma</hi> II. <hi>de Diis Syris, Cap.</hi> II. And there could not be a plainer Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration that a Man was a falſe Prophet, than if he endeavoured to draw them to the Worſhip of other gods; or if he pretended to ſpeak in the Name of any other god, (XVIII <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.) or if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to offer ſuch Sacrifices as God abhorred. Thus <hi>Ariſtander</hi> (as <hi>David Chytraeus</hi> notes) diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to be a falſe Prophet, though he foretold the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon;</hi> for he required Humane Sacrifices to be offered.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64710:112"/>

But though <hi>Cauſabon</hi> and <hi>Druſius,</hi> and other great Men are of this Opinion; yet the contrary is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Perſons of no ſmall note; becauſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, when he determines this Caſe, ſaith, <hi>Theſe things ye ought to have done, and not left the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Tithe</hi> here mentioned, I have ſhown elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where that it was the manner of the Eaſtern Princes, to receive the Tenth of the Fruits of their Country, for the Maintenance of their Miniſters and Officers; as we read 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> VIII. 15. In like manner God, the great King of all the Earth, and the peculiar So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign of this Country, required a Tenth of all their Increaſe, for the Maintenance of his Prieſts and Levites in his Service. After which he ordered alſo a further Tithe to be taken out of the Nine Parts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining (which was called the <hi>Second Tithe</hi>) to be ſpent in Feaſts at his Tabernacle. And this is with great reaſon, thought to be particularly enjoyned in theſe words; for of ſuch Tithes he ſpeaks in the next Verſe. It might ſeem indeed a little hard, to give another Tenth Part, after they had paid one already, which they might be tempted not to perform exactly; and therefore he ſaith, Thou ſhalt <hi>truly,</hi> that is, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, without any deceit or fraud, <hi>Tithe all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of thy Seed.</hi> And when this was done, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired alſo, once in three years, a <hi>third Tithe,</hi> for the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:64710:113"/>
uſe of the Poor, (See <hi>v.</hi> 28.) that they might alſo be entertained at his Coſt, though not at that time at his Houſe. For it was ſutable to his Royal Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that all his Subjects ſhould be feaſted by his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at his Palace; and that the pooreſt of them ſhould not be neglected, but ſome time or other partake of his Bounty; as they did at thoſe Feaſts I mentioned, where their Men-ſervants and Maid-ſervants were to be entertained, as well as the <hi>Levites,</hi> XII. 12, 18.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Tithe of thy Corn, and of thy Wine, and of thine Oil.]</hi> This cannot be meant of the Tithe paid to the <hi>Levites;</hi> of which the People were not to partake: but only the Prieſts, to whom the <hi>Levites</hi> were to give a Tithe. Therefore it muſt be underſtood of the <hi>ſecond Tithe,</hi> ſeparated (after the other was paid) for this holy uſe. The deſign of which was, that they might be ſecured in his Religion, by eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Preſence; and thereby profeſſing that they belong'd to him, and were his thankful Servants.</p>
               <p>The obſervation of <hi>R. Bechai</hi> upon theſe words <hi>[thy Corn, thy Wine, and thine Oil]</hi> is ſomething cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, but it hath a great deal of Truth in it. If thou pay the Tithe, ſaith he, then it is <hi>thy</hi> Corn; if thou do not, it is <hi>my</hi> Corn, and not thine (in like manner, if they paid the Tithe of Wine and Oil) for it is ſaid in II <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9. <hi>Therefore I will return and take away my Corn in the time thereof, and my Wine in the ſeaſon thereof.</hi> For they forfeited the whole, who did not pay the Tenth, which was the Rent God reſerved to himſelf. And the ſame <hi>R. Bechai</hi> repreſents this as a very merciful Law. For it is the faſhion of the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64710:113"/>
World, ſaith he, if a Man have Ground of his own, to let it out to Tenants at what rate he pleaſes, for an half, or third part to be paid to him. But it is not ſo with the Almighty, whoſe the Earth is, and who raiſes Clouds, and Waters it with Rain, and ſends down drops of Dew, and makes fat the Fruits of the Earth; and yet requires but one part of Ten, for his own uſes. This made it highly reaſonable that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould admoniſh the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſo often, diligently to pay their Tithe.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.]</hi> This juſtifies what I ſaid, that the deſign of this was to preſerve them ſtedfaſt in their Religion, by having Communion with him, in ſo ſolemn a manner every year: For that is meant by <hi>fearing the LORD alway;</hi> continuing in the Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of him alone.

All things likewiſe, which would not keep ſo long as till they could go to the Houſe of God, they were to turn into Money: but things that were not periſhable, they were to carry in kind, if they did not dwell too far off from it.</p>

For thus they explain it, That in the third year after the Year of Releaſe, and in the ſixth year, the Tithe that was wont to be carried to the place where the Sanctuary was, and there ſpent in Feaſts before God, was to be ſpent upon the Poor in every Town, where they that paid the Tithe lived: But every firſt, ſecond, fourth, and fifth year from the Year of Releaſe, it was ſpent in holy Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at the Houſe of God. In the Year of Releaſe it ſelf (which was every ſeventh year) no Tithes at all were paid of any kind, becauſe all lay common. So that every year the owner of the Ground ſet out a ſecond Tithe; but he was not bound to carry it eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> for in the compaſs of ſeven years, four of thoſe years only were appointed for their journey thither, and two they ſtaid at home.

It ſeems moſt reaſonable to expound it of the former; that if Mens occaſions called them home, they were not bound to ſtay any longer at the place where the Sanctuary was, but till they had eaten the Paſchal Lamb; after which they might return home if they pleaſed. So <hi>Bochartus;</hi> who from hence proves that the moſt Solemn Days of the Feaſt of unleavened Bread, were not obſerved like a Sabbath; becauſe Men might travel home upon the firſt Day of unleavened Bread, as the whole Nation travelled out of <hi>Egypt</hi> on this day, from <hi>Rameſes</hi> to <hi>Succoth.</hi> Yet pious People, who were able to bear ſo great a Charge, were wont, no doubt, to ſtay the whole ſeven Days before they returned home; becauſe the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>last</hi> Days of the Feaſt were great Solemnities. So they did in the <hi>Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi> of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXX. 21. XXXV. 17.

And when <hi>Joab</hi> adviſed him to come down, and ſhow himſelf publickly, it is ſaid, <hi>he roſe and ſat in the Gate, and all the People came before him,</hi> XIX. 6.

And the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudiſts</hi> unanimouſly agree that the number of Judges was proportionable to the greatneſs of the City where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were placed, and of the Cauſes which they judged. Where there were leſs than an Hundred and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:64710:128"/>
twenty Families in any Town or City, there was ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the loweſt Court of all, conſiſting of three Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which tried only Actions of Debt, or Damages done by Man or Beaſt, or Defamation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in Cities, where there were above an Hundred and twenty Families, there was placed an higher Court, conſiſting of Three and twenty Judges, who tried Capital Cauſes. <hi>Joſephus</hi> indeed differs from the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudiſts</hi> about the number, for he ſaith they were but Seven. Both of them, it is likely, may ſay true, with reſpect to different times and places: for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be preſumed that both he and they underſtood the ſtate of their Country, in ſuch Publick Matters. But at the place where God choſe to ſettle his Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, unto which all the Country reſorted at certain times, there was the Supream Court of all, conſiſting, as the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> ſay, of Seventy Perſons, beſides their Preſident; who judged all manner of Cauſes; and none but they could judge a falſe Prophet, or a City fall'n to Idolatry. All Appeals were made to them, but from them there was none, their Sentence being final. See <hi>Selden Lib.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedr. Cap.</hi> IV.</p>
               <p>Such a Court, it is certain, there was in future Ages, whoſe number was according to that of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Elders choſen by God himſelf to aſſiſt <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Government, and indued with the Spirit of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to qualifie them for that Office, XI <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.

Though it may be doubted, whether after <hi>Moſes</hi> his death, and the death of the Elders, there was a Court conſiſting of ſo many Judges. Nay, it is highly probable that this Conſiſtory it ſelf was not conſtantly ſettled there,

according to Law, till the time of <hi>Jehoſaphat:</hi> at leaſt, not the Inferior Conſiſtories before-mentioned, which were to be ſettled in every City.

Certain it is, that nothing was more ancient in the Eaſt, than Altars with Groves of Trees about them; which made the place very ſhady and delightful in thoſe hot Countries.

VI <hi>Judges</hi> 25, &amp;c. <hi>Cadmus</hi> is thought by ſome to have brought this Cuſtom into <hi>Greece,</hi> out of the Eaſt. And they planted the Trees ſo thick, and they were ſo large and ſhady, as to make the place very dark and ſolemn; whereby a kind of Horror was ſtruck into thoſe, who went into them. And they became hereby the fitter for the Devil to play his Pranks there; and for the practiſe of thoſe obſcene and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth Rites whereby he was worſhipped.

See XII. 2, 3. And therefore the Jews ſay they might not plant Trees in the Court of the Temple, or in the Mountain of the Houſe (as they call it) for the Ornament or Beauty of God's Houſe. And they give this reaſon for it, becauſe it was an idolatrous Rite to plant Trees near their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, that the People might there meet together. See

                  <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf; to whom God joyned Seventy Perſons for his Aſſiſtance; all hard Cauſes being brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. But this Authority of the Captains laſted no longer than during their Pilgrimage in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; for when they came to <hi>Canaan</hi> the Law, as I now obſerved, required <hi>Judges and Officers</hi> to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in every City. Who, if there fell any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about the Law, are here ordered to repair to the place where the Sanctuary was, for there the higheſt Court ſat; as the Succeſſors of <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Seventy Elders, (mentioned XI <hi>Numb.</hi> 16, 24, &amp;c.) who judged all difficult Cauſes while he lived.</p>

And Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> produces a great many other Inſtances of the like Phraſe (<hi>Lib.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedr. Cap.</hi> VIII. <hi>N.</hi> 2, 3.) and ſhows they are ſo deſcribed (as the Jews think) to exclude all others that had been Prieſts, before God took the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> peculiarly to ſerve him in this Office. But the <hi>Levites,</hi> as well as Prieſts, they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agree, were capable to be Members of this great <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi> Which they all likewiſe ſay, did not conſiſt only of Prieſts and Levites, but of any other Perſons of other Tribes, who were fit to be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this Dignity. Nay, they ſay if there was not one <hi>Priest</hi> or <hi>Levite</hi> in the Court, it was a lawful Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature: For the High-Prieſt himſelf, no more than any Man elſe had a place here, meerly for his Birth, unleſs his Learning in the Law was anſwerable. So <hi>Maimonides</hi> and others. And thoſe other Members,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64710:134"/>
who were not Prieſts, nor Levites, they think are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the word <hi>Judge;</hi> which, though it be in the ſingular number, may be thought to ſignifie more than one, as appears from XIX. 17. where it is ſaid expreſly they ſhall bring the Controverſie there mentioned, <hi>before the Prieſts and the Judges.</hi> And further, that <hi>Judge,</hi> after the manner of this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage may ſignifie <hi>Judges, Conſtantine L'Empereur</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from <hi>v.</hi> 12. where <hi>Priest</hi> in the ſingular number is uſed for thoſe who are here called <hi>Priests</hi> in the plural, <hi>Annot. in Corn. Bertram. p.</hi> 389.</p>
               <p>But howſoever this be, it ſeems to me that, though the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> were not the only Perſons of whom this High Court conſiſted (the Members of which might be choſen out of any Tribe, where they could find men qualified) yet they are here firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, becauſe they were likely to be the moſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſons to exerciſe this Authority; eſpecially in the firſt Conſtitution of this Commonwealth, when they were newly entred into <hi>Canaan.</hi> For all other Perſons were then buſily employed in looking after the Inheritance that was fall'n to them, and ſettling the Affairs of their ſeveral Families; whereby they were rendred leſs able to attend unto this weighty Office. But the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> having no Inheritance among them, (as is often repeated in theſe Books) and no care a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Husbandry, and ſuch like Affairs, had a full lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure both to ſtudy the Laws of God, and to judge according to them; eſpecially being appointed by God to <hi>teach Jacob his Judgments, and Iſrael his Law,</hi> XXXIII. 10. Beſides, this Court being ſettled at the place of God's Worſhip, where a great many Prieſts and Levites always neceſſarily attended, they were moſt ready, without any inconvenience to themſelves, to
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64710:134"/>
execute this Office of Judges, having their Maintenance from the Publick, which no other Perſons had. But otherwiſe, as I ſaid, they had no more right than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men, to be Members of this Court. Which we cannot certainly ſay conſiſted of Seventy Judges, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their <hi>Naſi,</hi> i. e. their Prince, or Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; nor that they always ſat at the place here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. For there were ſometimes great Troubles in the Land, and they were under the power of their Enemies; which extreamly diſturbed their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and made it neceſſary for God to raiſe them up extraordinary <hi>Judges;</hi> becauſe the power of this Court was broken in pieces. So Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, that there were great Intermiſſions of their ſitting, in the times of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and of <hi>Herod</hi> the great, <hi>Lib.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedriis, Cap.</hi> XIV. <hi>N.</hi> III. And therefore why not in the times, when they were oppreſſed by the <hi>Moabites, Ammonites, Philiſtines,</hi> and other cruel Neighbours in the days of the <hi>Judges?</hi> And thus <hi>Grotius, Hermannus Conringius</hi> (to name no more) here underſtand the word <hi>Judge,</hi> who is joyned with the Prieſt and Levites.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And unto the Judge.]</hi> The fore-named Authors thus tranſlate this Verſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt come unto the Prieſts the Levites, or unto the Judge that ſhall be in thoſe days.</hi> Where by <hi>Judge</hi> they underſtand ſuch as <hi>Othniel, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hud, Gideon, Jephtah, Sampſon, Samuel,</hi> and others, whom God raiſed up, when they were oppreſſed by their Enemies, and in great Confuſions, to govern his People: which they did with the higheſt Authority, being equal to Kings, ſave only that they kept not Royal State or Equipage; but are plainly called by that Name, XVII <hi>Judg.</hi> 6. XIX. 1. XXI. 25. Now though the <hi>Prieſts and Levites (i. e.</hi> that Court, of which
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:64710:135"/>
they made a conſiderable part) were the ordinary Supream Judges of Controverſies, yet the JUDGE, when God raiſed one up, was endued with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary power above theirs; to whom the People therefore reſorted for his deciſion. For juſt as all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Magiſtrates among the <hi>Romans</hi> gave place to a <hi>Dictator,</hi> when they had one, ſo all the Hebrew Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates did to ſuch a JUDGE when God appointed him: who determined all manner of Controverſies, as at other times, the other Judges, whether Prieſts or others, were wont to do. See <hi>Herman. Conringius de Republ. Ebraeorum, Sect.</hi> XXXIX.</p>
               <p>I know but one Objection againſt this, which is, That thoſe extraordinary Judges were not fixed, as far as we can find, in the place where the Sanctuary was; unleſs we may judge of all the reſt by <hi>Eli</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> who ſeem to have been ſettled there. But we muſt conſider that they were not confined by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which was not grounded on this Law, to any one certain place; but left at liberty to live where they thought moſt convenient, for the diſcharge of their Truſt, in the Reformation of the People. And the truth of what I ſaid concerning their Supream Power plainly appears in <hi>Samuel,</hi> who went up and down the Country executing Judgment, when <hi>Shilo</hi> was deſtroyed, and had no Court, like that which the Jews ſpeak of, to aſſiſt him. But when he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſſiſtance, he appointed his Sons to be Judges, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> VIII. 1. of whom when the Elders complained, <hi>v.</hi> 4. becauſe they did not diſcharge their Duty well, it was to himſelf, and not to any other Perſons; and they deſire not a <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> but a <hi>King</hi> to judge them, <hi>v.</hi> 5. Which Petition we do not find that he communicated to the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> but only unto God:
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:64710:135"/>
nor is any mention made of them in the choice of a King, or after he was choſen, in the Hiſtory of their Kings, till <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi>'s time, no more than there is in the Book of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Judges.</hi> Where we read, that when there was <hi>no King</hi> (that is, <hi>Judge) in Iſrael,</hi> every Man did what was right in his own eyes: which is a ſign that there wanted ſuch a Court to keep them in order. After the time of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> who ſettled Judges in every City (as I obſerved XVI. 18.) they continued, it is plain, till the Captivity: but what number there was of them we do not know. After the Captivity <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſeem to have done all themſelves, (See IX and X <hi>Nehem.</hi>) which makes it very probable, that, though there were Judges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed according to the direction of this Law, yet the exerciſe of their Power was often interrupted by the great Changes which were in that Nation; and that there was no ſuch <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> as the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> deſcribe, till the Time of the <hi>Maccabees.</hi> For the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Name of <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> plainly ſhews its Original to have been, when the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue was common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews;</hi> and that was, when the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> (who were of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Race) had the chief power in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> See <hi>Conringius</hi> in the forenamed Book, <hi>Sect.</hi> XXXVII.</p>

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64710:136"/>

So that if this Court deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined a Matter, which in after times by other Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the ſame Court, ſhould be judged otherways, that ſecond Sentence was to ſtand, being the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>of thoſe days.</hi> For this Sentence was, in their judgment, the meaning of the Law, by which they were all to be governed; and, if there was no Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the Caſe, they judged themſelves as well as they could.</p>

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:64710:136"/>
but reſt in their Deciſions. For in all Governments there muſt be an end of Suits, ſome where or other: and God required all his People to ſubmit to the Sentence of this Court.

But they have a great deal of reaſon on their ſide, who inſiſt upon the Letter of this word <hi>Priest,</hi> and of that which follows, or <hi>the Judge</hi> (underſtanding both of ſingle Perſons) and take the <hi>High-Priest</hi> only to be here meant: who ſeems to be deſcribed in the next words, <hi>that ſtands to miniſter there before the LORD thy God.</hi> For when God did not raiſe up <hi>a Judge</hi> to govern his People, the High-Prieſt was the Supream Governour under God until the days of <hi>David:</hi> and ſo they were after the Captivity. Hence it is, as <hi>Grotius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves (<hi>Lib. de Imperio Summarum Poteſtatum circa Sacra, Cap.</hi> IX. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.) that <hi>COHEN</hi> is a name common to Prieſts, and Princes: For among a great many Nations anciently he ſhows, the Prieſts had the higheſt power; particularly among the <hi>Cappadoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (Strabo,</hi> who was of that Country, ſaith) the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64710:137"/>
Sacerdotal Dignity was next to the Regal. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever this word be interpreted, the Crime here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned was Contumacy, in not ſubmitting to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the higheſt Authority, whether it were veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one Perſon, or more: whereby the Government was in danger to be broken; and therefore God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſuch a perſon to be put to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or the Judge.]</hi> See before <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Even that man ſhall die.]</hi> The Jews, who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret this, as I ſaid, of a Judge in Inferiour Courts, who preſumed to contradict the Judgment of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Court, have tempered the Severity of this Law, by ſeveral Explications and Exceptions. Which have regard either to the <hi>manner</hi> of paſſing this Decree by the higheſt Court, which an inferiour diſobeyed; and that was when a Cauſe came before them upon an Appeal, (for it was not ſo Criminal to diſobey every Sentence of the Supream Court, but only ſuch as theſe) or to the <hi>place</hi> where it was made; which was to be no where elſe, but at God's dwelling place: or to the <hi>things</hi> about which the Decree was made; which ſome will have to be only weighty Matters: and the act of Contumacy alſo was conſidered; for he was not put to death, they ſay, unleſs in open Court he declared a contrary Sentence. The death he ſuffered was ſtrangling: and he could ſuffer in no other place, but where this High Court ſat. See <hi>Selden</hi> of all theſe, in the place before-mentioned, <hi>N.</hi> II, III, IV, V, VI. And it may be further obſerved, that the Prophets themſelves were ſubject to the Power and Juriſdiction of this High Court: by whom they might be ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Capital Puniſhment, if they taught contrary to the Law of God. But our Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> makes a doubt, whether the Conſtitution which the Jewiſh
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:64710:138"/>
Writers mention, about a <hi>Rebellious Elder</hi> (as they call him who taught any thing contrary to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Supream Court) was ever in force, or no? For it was made, becauſe of the differences between the Schools of <hi>Hillel</hi> and <hi>Sammai,</hi> who lived not long before our Saviour's time: when it appears by the Goſpel, that Nation had loſt the Power of Life and Death.

For when <hi>Sheſhak</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> (whom the Greek Writers call <hi>Seſoſtris</hi>) came againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there were Threeſcore thouſand Horſe-men in his Army, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XII. 3.

many ſorts; and one was by raking into the bowels of their Sacrifices, particularly of Humane Sacrifices: by the obſervation of which they pretended to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell things, as many Authors teſtifie. Yea, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered little Children on purpoſe, that thereby they might make their Auguries, as the ſame <hi>Geuſius</hi> hath obſerved in that Book, <hi>Cap.</hi> XXI. Unto which perhaps there is a peculiar reſpect in this place: for I find moſt of the things here mentioned, joyned in other places with <hi>making their Children paſs through the fire;</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly 2 <hi>Kings</hi> XXI. 6. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXXIII. 6. and the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſeems to intimate that hereby they divined, when he charges the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with this crime, XX. 26, 31. For he adds, <hi>Shall I be enquired by you, O Houſe of Iſrael?</hi> Who have enquired, that is, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your Children paſs through the fire.</p>
               <p>But it muſt be confeſſed that the Hebrew words <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſem koſemim</hi> (which we tranſlate <hi>uſeth divination</hi>) are by many thought to have a peculiar reſpect unto ſuch, as uſed to divine by caſting or drawing of Lots.

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:64710:147"/>
Letters or Marks upon which they fell, the divination was made; as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> deſcribes it in his <hi>Achaica.</hi> In other places they uſed them in a different manner; and the ancient <hi>Arabians</hi> divined by Arrows, as our famous Dr. <hi>Pocock</hi> hath ſhown in his Notes upon <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor.

ſuch Perſons to call for the Dead to appear to them.

But though this may be allowed to be intimated, and this Promiſe be acknowledged to be partly veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in thoſe Prophets which God raiſed up from Age to Age after <hi>Moſes,</hi> for further knowledge of his Will (as the promiſe of a Saviour was in part verified in thoſe Judges and Kings by whom God delivered his People from their Enemies) yet it is very evident that

he ſpeaks of a ſingle Prophet more eminent than all the reſt: and that theſe words, in their moſt literal ſenſe, cannot belong to any other Perſon, but the MESSIAH. So that albeit the continuance of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets among this People, was a means to prevent all occaſions of conſulting Sorcerers, or Witches; yet the chief ground upon which <hi>Moſes</hi> diſſwades them from ſuch practices, according to the literal connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe words with the foregoing, <hi>[the LORD thy God hath not ſuffered thee to do ſo]</hi> i. e. to hearken unto Obſervers of Times and Diviners, was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of their late mighty Deliverance by <hi>Moſes;</hi> the excellency of their preſent Law, which God had given them for their direction; and their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a greater Law-giver in future times: when the firſt Covenant ſhould wax old, and Prophecy it ſelf for a long time fail; as it did before the Coming of this great Prophet, the LORD CHRIST.

there being none of them like to <hi>Moſes:</hi> whom God himſelf diſtinguiſhed from them all, XII <hi>Numb.</hi> 6, 7, 8. And accordingly that Divine Writer, who added thoſe Verſes which are at the end of this Book, (concerning the Death of <hi>Moſes</hi>) teſtifies that there never roſe in <hi>Iſrael</hi> a Prophet like to <hi>Moſes.</hi> See XXXIV <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. It is commonly thought to be done by <hi>Ezra,</hi> who hath effectually confuted all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of <hi>R. Bechai, Aben-Ezra, Abarbinel,</hi> and other Jewiſh Doctors, who take either <hi>Joſhua</hi> or <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to have been this Prophet. If <hi>Joſhua,</hi> as ſome fancy, added theſe words, then he excluded himſelf from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Perſon: nor did <hi>Joſhua</hi> act as a Prophet, but as a Judge, or Governour. And <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>Abarbinel</hi> himſelf to be inferiour to <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> For though in his Preface to his Commentary upon <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> he mentions Fourteen things wherein he was like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſaith he propheſied juſt <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> years, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did; yet in his Commentary upon the leſſer Prophets, he prefers <hi>Iſaiah</hi> before them all: and Cenſures the rudeneſs of <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Language; in many things preferring <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to him. So little do theſe Doctors agree in their Interpretation of this Prophecy; which can belong to none of their Prophets which ſucceeded <hi>Moſes</hi> (who were all much inferiour to him) until <hi>He</hi> came, who perfectly reſembled him, but was much ſuperior to him. See <hi>v.</hi> 18.

For <hi>Nachmanides</hi> (relating in a Letter of his to the <hi>Rabbins</hi> at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> how there was a Man in thoſe days, in the Southern Countries, who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the forerunner of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> unto whom great numbers, both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Arabs</hi> reſorted) tells us, that he being apprehended by the King of the Country, and askt what Miracle he ſhow'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>22</label> LORD.]</hi> Predicting ſome wonderful thing to come to paſs, as a Token he is ſent of God to deliver what he ſpeaks to the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the thing follow not, nor come to paſs, that is the thing which the LORD hath not ſpoken.]</hi> For if the LORD had ſent him, he would have accompliſhed what he gave as a ſign of his Miſſion: which not coming to paſs, he was proved to be a falſe Prophet, who ſpake out of his own heart, and not the Word of the LORD. But here the <hi>Jews</hi> diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Prophet who predicts <hi>evil</hi> things, as Famine,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:64710:156"/>
or Peſtilence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and one that predicts <hi>good</hi> things, as Rain (when there is great need of it) and fruitful years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though the Predictions of the former ſort did not come to paſs, he was not to be reputed preſently a falſe Prophet, becauſe God is very merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and often repented him of the evil: as he did in the Caſe of <hi>Nineveh.</hi> But in the latter Caſe, if any one of the good Things he foretold did not come to paſs, he was to be taken for a Deceiver: which they underſtand alſo of the very time and place, when and where he ſaid the things he predicted ſhould be fulfilled: and here they bring in the example of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naniah,</hi> the Son of <hi>Azur,</hi> mentioned before XXVIII <hi>Jer.</hi> 11. And ſee <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. of that Chapter. But this doth not give us the true difference: for both God's Promiſes and Threatnings many times depend upon a Condition, as appears from that famous place in the Prophet, XVIII <hi>Jerem.</hi> 7, 8, 9. So that the good Things a Prophet foretold might not come to paſs, and yet he might be a true Prophet; becauſe the People proved unworthy of them, and God did not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely intend them. Therefore the true meaning ſeems to be, That if a Prophet foretold ſuch a Thing as the Power of Nature cannot produce, and gave it as a ſign God ſent him, who would juſtifie his Miſſion by doing that wonder; and the Thing did not come to paſs: he was to be lookt upon as not a Man of God. For example; when <hi>Moſes</hi> threw his Rod on the ground, and ſaid it ſhould become a Serpent; if it had not been turned into a Serpent, he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of Falſity. Or a Prophet ſaid Fire ſhould come down from Heaven, and conſume the Sacrifice which lay before him, which was the caſe of <hi>Elijah,</hi> if it had not come down, he would have been no
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:64710:156"/>
more owned for a true Prophet, than the Prophets of <hi>Baal.</hi> And, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> well obſerves, if a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's words were fulfilled in one, or more Things, he was not to be judged a true Prophet, unleſs every Thing he ſpake in the Name of God came to paſs. Which he proves from thoſe words concerning <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> III. 19, 20. The LORD <hi>let none of his words fall to the ground: And all Iſrael knew that Samuel was eſtabliſhed to be a Prophet of the LORD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> alſo made this addition to the Rule fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned of trying Prophets, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves, <hi>Lib.</hi> III. <hi>de Synedr. Cap.</hi> V. <hi>N.</hi> III. That <hi>whatſoever Prophet had the Teſtimony of another undoubted Prophet, was to be taken for a true Prophet.</hi> By which Rule they might have known the great Prophet, whom God promiſed to them in the foregoing Verſes. For <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, whom the whole Nation took for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, teſtified to them that JESUS was the <hi>Christ.</hi> And beſides all other undoubted Marks of his being ſent of God, <hi>his riſing from the Dead,</hi> which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf foretold, was enough to ſatisfie all Men of the Truth of what he ſaid. For though every Prediction of what afterwards comes to paſs, will not neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove a Man to be a true Prophet; yet the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a great number of Things, (not one of which fails, as was ſaid before of <hi>Samuel</hi>) eſpecially of ſuch a Thing as this, which was impoſſible to be brought to paſs, but by an Almighty Power, is an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Evidence of a Divine Miſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R. Solomon,</hi> upon this Verſe, hath a Note which is worth our Obſervation, though it be not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> his words: <hi>A Prophet,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that bids thee not obſerve ſome of the Precepts, is not to be heard, unleſs he be known to be a Man of eminent Vertue, and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:64710:157"/>
upright Life, as</hi> Elijah <hi>was, who bid them build an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar on Mount</hi> Carmel, <hi>even when Sacrifices upon High-places were forbidden. But there was a neceſſity for it, that he might reſtore the true Worſhip of God in</hi> Iſrael. Which ſhould have made them <hi>hearken</hi> to our bleſſed Saviour, better than they did; he being ſo perfectly holy and pure, that he challenged any of them to charge him with Sin; eſpecially when he only laid aſide ſome of their vain Traditions; but conformed to all the Rites of <hi>Moſes.</hi> So that if, in concluſion, we ſhould grant that <hi>Moſes</hi> (in the 15th and 16th, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Verſes) ſpeaks of all the Prophets that ſhould ſucceed him (which it is certain he doth not princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intend) the <hi>Jews</hi> were impious in rejecting our Saviour, who came as a Prophet to them; and had all the Marks that a Prophet could have, of his being ſent from God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Prophet hath ſpoken it preſumptuouſly.]</hi> For it was an act of high Preſumption, and arrogant Pride, for any Man to pretend a Commiſſion from God, when he had not ſent him. Which was done two ways, as the Jews interpret this: either when a Man ſpake in the Name of God, that which was falſe; or when he pretended that to have been ſpoken to him, which was revealed by God to another. (See XXII <hi>Jerem.</hi> 30.) Both theſe were impudent Impoſtors, and accordingly to be treated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not be afraid of him.]</hi> Have no reverence or regard to him, though he be never ſo confident. Nor be afraid to lay hold of him, and endeavour to bring him before the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> to have their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſs upon him, (as the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtand it) though he have never ſo powerful an Intereſt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him, and preſerve him from puniſhment.

His Office was to blow with the Trumpets, to make the following Speech unto the Army, when they were preparing to joyn battle; and when they firſt went out, to exhort all new Builders, Planters, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Men to return back; and when they were drawn up in Battalia, to exhort all that were faint-hearted to leave the Army, and go home. See XXXI <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. A great many of the Jewiſh Doctors thus explain this, particularly <hi>Maimonides,</hi> who may ſerve inſtead of all. See <hi>Schickard.

For Souldiers, ſaith he, in the time of War, have great need to be heartned and confirmed in their reſolution. And becauſe the more honourable any one is, the more willingly Men hearken to him; therefore the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that he who was to encourage others, ſhould be a ſelect Perſon himſelf, and a Prieſt; to whom they would be apt to pay a great Reverence.</p>

               <p>But there was a particular reaſon for ſuch an one in this Caſe, (wherein the Heifer was not to be offered) that it might the better repreſent, as many think, the Perſon that had committed this Murder: who was a <hi>Son of Belial,</hi> ſubject to no Law; and deſerved to be beheaded as this Heifer was. It is not required that it ſhould be without blemiſh, as thoſe Heifers were to be, that were offered at the Tabernacle: but it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:64710:174"/>
if it had never been accuſtomed to the Yoke. Yet this is not to be taken without all Limitation; for if it wanted any Member, or were diſeaſed, it might not be imployed in this Service; as <hi>Wagenſeil</hi> obſerves out of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> in the place forenamed, <hi>p.</hi> 907.</p>

By which it appears that this ſolemn Proceſs here mentioned tended very much to detect the Murderer.

For though he acknowledges it is the common Opinion of their <hi>wiſe Men,</hi> that a Souldier might lie with a fair Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive once, whilſt ſhe was a meer Gentile; yet herein they followed the Doctors in the <hi>Babylonian Talmud;</hi> which is not of ſo great Antiquity as the <hi>Hieruſalem Talmud:</hi> where <hi>R.

For ſhaving her Head (which every one knows was uſed in mourning) deprived her of one of her greateſt Ornaments, and made her leſs amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and conſequently might extinguiſh his Affection, which was kindled by her Beauty.

it. Which was intended to make her look ugly, and to ſlack his love to her. At leaſt, it was ſutable to the Condition of a Mourner; as ſhe plainly was, it appears by the next Verſe. The Hebrew words indeed (which are <hi>make her Nails</hi>) are dubious; from whence aroſe that diſpute we find in the <hi>Talmud</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>R.

But the other Doctor turns it quite contrary; what was ordered about her Hair was to make her abominable, therefore this alſo was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make her appear ill-favoured. And indeed the Hebrew word being indifferent to either ſenſe, we muſt judge of the meaning by the circumſtances of the place: and here they ſeem to lead us to <hi>R.

This was a merciful Law to the Captive; that if ſhe were a Virgin, ſhe might bewail her unhappineſs, in not being diſpoſed of in Marriage by her Parents: If a Widow, that ſhe had loſt her firſt Love, and was now to be married to one, who would be her Lord, as well as her Husband.</q>

                  <hi>Thou ſhalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and ſhe ſhall be thy wife.]</hi> If he continued, that is, to love her
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:64710:179"/>
at the end of the Month; and ſhe was willing to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Jewiſh Religion, in which, while ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained retired in his Houſe, ſhe was inſtructed. For, the Jewiſh Doctors agree, ſhe was to be baptized, and not meerly made a Proſelyte of the Gate (<hi>i. e.</hi> renounce Idolatry) otherwiſe he might not marry her. And if ſhe refuſed to embrace their Religion intirely, <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> ſaith, they gave her a years time to conſider of it: at the end of which, if ſhe remained ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, they required her at leaſt to obſerve the Seven Precepts of the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> and ſo to become a Proſelyte of the Gate: otherwiſe ſhe was to be ſlain. But though ſhe was ſo far converted, no Jew might take her to Wife: for ſuch a Marriage, <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſaith, was counted impious.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Hebrew Doctors who think a Souldier might enjoy her once, at the firſt taking her Captive, have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another conceit to this; <hi>viz.</hi> That there was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Months time allowed her to bewail her Parents, but that he was to ſtay two Months more, before he <hi>might go in to her, and be her husband,</hi> that he might ſee whether ſhe were with Child or no, by his firſt enjoyment of her. For if ſhe were, a great difference was to be made between that Child, and thoſe ſhe might have by him after marriage. Concerning which ſee <hi>Selden Lib.</hi> V. <hi>de Jure Nat. &amp; Gent. Cap.</hi> XIII. where he obſerves, they make <hi>Tamar,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>David,</hi> an inſtance of this. Whoſe Mother being a Captive, they ſuppoſe he lay with her as ſoon as ſhe was taken, and had this Iſſue by her: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhe becoming a Proſelyte, he made her his Wife, and ſhe bare him <hi>Abſolom.</hi> Whereby it came to paſs, that there was not ſuch a Relation between her and the other Sons of <hi>David</hi> by other Women; but that
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:64710:179"/>
it had been lawful for <hi>Amnon</hi> to have married her.</p>
               <p>But all this is judged by the famous <hi>Abarbinel</hi> (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> XIII.) to be very abſurd: and neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that <hi>David</hi> would have committed ſuch a Fact, as to lie with a Woman in her Gentiliſm; nor, if he had, that this Child would have been lookt upon as a Gentile, ſince he afterward married her Mother. And therefore he takes thoſe words of <hi>Tamar,</hi> v. 13. <hi>Speak to the King, and he will not withhold me from thee,</hi> to be a meer put off, as we ſpeak, to get rid of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: which <hi>Amnon</hi> underſtood very well, who knowing he could not have her to Wife, proceeded to force her.</p>

This he <hi>lost,</hi> ſay the Jews, by his ſhort pleaſure he took at firſt. For other Captives, whom a Man had made himſelf Maſter of, by the Law of War, he might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in his Work as Slaves, or make Money of them; but one whom he had lain with, he was either to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or ſet her a liberty. This they ground upon the laſt words of this Verſe; which I ſhall ſhow may have another interpretation. And therefore I ſhall not inſiſt upon their ſenſe (which depends upon the ſame words) who think <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of his not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her after ſhe was become his Wife, her Humour, Manners, and Converſation being diſagreeable to him:
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:64710:180"/>
in which caſe he was to give her a Bill of Divorce, as he might do another Wife, but not keep her as a Slave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe thou hast humbled her.]</hi> It muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that this is an uſual Phraſe, for having had Carnal Knowledge of a Woman, as the Scripture mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly elſewhere ſpeaks, in the like caſe.

From which I ſee no reaſon why we ſhould depart in this place; for it was ſufficient Affliction and Humiliation to a Captive Woman (as <hi>Carpſovius</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Annotations</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Schickard</hi>'s Book, which I have ſo often named) that after ſhe had been brought into a Souldiers Houſe, and kept there a Month, having her Head ſhaved, Garments changed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in hope of Marriage, ſhe was rejected at laſt when it ſhould have been conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And thus <hi>Abarbinel</hi> here underſtands the word <hi>humbled,</hi> not of his lying with her; but of all the forementioned Conditions which were impoſed upon her, as a preparation for his Bed; and of her diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment after ſhe had ſubmitted to be baptized.

For they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, what thoſe Doctors did not, that <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not here give a reaſon, why the Man was hanged up, but why he was to be taken down from the Gallows. Now what Conſequence is there in this, <hi>Let him be taken down and buried, becauſe he curſed God?</hi> Every
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:64710:184"/>
one ſees, that (though the word <hi>curſed</hi> ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in an active ſenſe) this is not a right interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe words. For though it had been good ſenſe to have ſaid, Let him be hanged, becauſe he curſed God; yet not let him be taken down for that reaſon. Now ſuch Perſons are ſaid here to be accurſed of God, not becauſe they were hanged up, but becauſe of their Sin which deſerved they ſhould be thus expoſed. So S. <hi>Hierom</hi> upon III <hi>Galatians, Non ideo maledictus quia pendet, ſed ideo pendet quia maledictus.</hi> He was not accurſed becauſe he was han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but he was therefore hanged, becauſe he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed: Hanging up being a Token that the Man had committed a horrid Crime, whereby he had incurred the high diſpleaſure of Almighty God. So that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one who ſaw him hang on that faſhion, were to think with themſelves, This Man was under the Curſe of God, becauſe of his Sin. And unleſs he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone this Curſe, he could not have been buried, and put into the Condition of other Men. But when he had undergone it for his Sin, then it had been a ſin in the People not to have taken him down, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed his Suſpenſion longer than God impoſed this Curſe upon him. And the Land had been defiled, if after this Suffering which God had appointed, they had not buried him. To this purpoſe <hi>Abarbinel,</hi> who refutes ſeveral other accounts of this matter, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that of <hi>Sol. Jarchi;</hi> who thinks he was not to hang longer than till the Evening, becauſe it would have been a diſhonour to the Soveraign of the World, after whoſe Image Man was made. This is followed by many, and even by <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf, who gives no other reaſon of it in his Book <hi>de Jure Belli &amp; Pacis, Lib.</hi> II. <hi>Cap.</hi> XIX. <hi>Sect.</hi> IV. But this is a reaſon, as

                  <hi>Abarbinel</hi> notes, why he ſhould not have been hanged up at all. It may be alſo uſefully noted further, that they ſay in the Tract called <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> that not only the Malefactor, but all the Inſtruments of Puniſhment were to be buried at the going down of the Sun. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Tree it ſelf, upon which he was hanged, was to be buried, <hi>that no memory of ſo foul a thing might be left in the World; nor any might ſay, Behold, this was the Tree upon which ſuch a one was hang'd.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>That the Land be not defiled which the LORD thy God giveth thee.]</hi> By the ſtench of the Body, after it putrified, as the ſame <hi>Abarbinel</hi> expounds it: who obſerves, that the dead Body of no Creature corrupts and ſtinks ſooner than that of a Man; which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding offenſive to the living. For which cauſe, ſaith he, the Book <hi>Siphre</hi> determines not only that all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors ſhould be buried, as ſoon as the Law here orders (that they might not imitate the manners of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> and ſuch like People, who let Bodies rot in the Air after they were hanged up) but that every Man ſhould bury his dead, the ſame day they died, or be deemed to have tranſgreſſed a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precept. Which may paſs for a very good <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> reaſon of it: but there is ſomething more in it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting a Legal Pollution, under which their whole Country lay, as long as an accurſed thing hung open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among them; juſt as all that entred into the Tent where a dead Body lay, and all that was in it, were made unclean by it, XIX <hi>Numb.</hi> 14, 15. Upon which ſcore S. <hi>Paul</hi> might well apply this Paſſage to Chriſt crucified for us; not only becauſe he bare our ſins, and was put to death, and expoſed to ſuch ſhame as theſe Sinners were, who were accurſed of God; but was alſo taken down in the Evening, in token now
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:64710:185"/>
the guilt was removed;<note place="margin">Chapter XXII.</note> as the Curſe upon the Man that was hanged, ended at the going down of the Sun; and as the Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was pure and clean, after the dead Body was taken down and buried, with the Tree upon which it was hanged. <hi>Joh. Coch</hi> hath well explained this, in his Notes upon the <hi>Sanhedrim, Cap.</hi> VI. <hi>Sect.</hi> V. whoſe ſenſe in ſhort is this: <hi>As our bleſſed Saviour, while he hung upon the Croſs, was made a Curſe, and an Execration; ſo when, according to the Law, he was taken down, and buried, both he ceaſed to be a Curſe, and all they that are his.</hi>

But this is a very unreaſonable Subtilty; the intention of the Law being, that they might be put in remembrance of God's Commandments, by theſe Fringes; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were to be worn in the Skirts of their Garments, though they had been divided into no wings, or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at all.</p>

And therefore I do not ſee any reaſon in the determination of their Doctors, who ſay <hi>Women, Servants,</hi> and <hi>little Children</hi> were not bound to wear Fringes: For though little Children could not think of the Commandments of God, yet it was fit they ſhould wear the Note of their Religion. There is no reaſon neither in their Reſolution, when they ſay, That if Women and Servants (who were bound as much as others to obſerve the Laws of God) would
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:64710:190"/>
wear Fringes, though they were not obliged by their Conſtitutions, yet they might not put them on with the common Form of Benediction which they uſed.

confeſs it. This Caſe is different from that in XXII <hi>Exod.</hi> 16, 17. in many reſpects. For that Law ſpeaks of one that was drawn in to conſent to the Man's ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her, by inticing words (which is expreſly there mentioned) and fair Promiſes perhaps of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; but here <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of one that <hi>laid hold of her,</hi> i. e. deflowred her by force and violence. In this Caſe the Man was bound to marry her, if ſhe and her Father pleaſed (for both their Conſents were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, though the Man that deflowred her could not refuſe) but in the former Caſe the Man himſelf might chooſe whether he would marry or no; which he could not refuſe in this; and beſides, was bound to pay <hi>fifty Shekels,</hi> as a Mulct upon him for the Crime, as follows in the next Verſe.

The reaſon is plain; becauſe there was no need of ſettling a Dowry in this Caſe, as in the former; for the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was ſettled upon her in that Caſe, leſt the Husband might lightly and wantonly put her away by Divorce, and ſhe have nothing to maintain her: of which there was no danger here, becauſe this Law ſaith expreſly in the concluſion of this Verſe, that <hi>he may not put her away all his days.</hi> Yet there are thoſe who think it likely, that in this Caſe alſo, he ſettled a Dowry of <hi>fifty</hi> Shekels upon her, beſides what he paid for her further; for otherwiſe the Condition of a Virgin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowred by Force, was worſe than hers deflowred by her own Conſent.</p>

                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:64710:195"/>They have ſome Exceptions concerning this Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to her Father, which are not very material, nor certain. But this is conſiderable, That this Fine was the ſame, whether the Woman was of Noble, or of Mean Parentage; neither more nor leſs was paid by the Law. But, in after times, the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> they tell us, added ſome other Mulcts beſides this here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; becauſe it ſeemed ſo ſmall that the Honour of a Virgin was not thought ſufficiently repaired by it. Therefore he that inticed a Virgin paid other two; one for the Shame and Diſhonour he had done her; and the other for the loſs of her Virginity, and vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her Body. And he that forced a Virgin paid a third beſides theſe two; upon the account of the Pain unto which, he was ſuppoſed, to have put her. And in theſe three they proportioned the Penalties to the quality of the Perſon, and other Conſiderations, which made them vary. See <hi>Selden</hi> in the forenamed place, <hi>p.</hi> 123.</p>

                  <hi>And ſhe ſhall be his wife, becauſe he hath humbled her.]</hi> Though ſhe were blind, or lame, or leprous, he could not refuſe her; if ſhe and her Father required him to marry her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He may not put her away all his days.]</hi> This was a third part of his Puniſhment for the force he had committed; that he ſhould be forced, not only to take her to Wife, but conſtrained alſo to keep her as long as ſhe lived, and not have the liberty of giving her a Bill of Divorce; as other Men might do, who were deſirous to part with their Wives.</p>
               <p>If it be askt, How it could be known whether ſhe was inticed, or forced? They anſwer, as was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before, that it was reaſonably preſumed that he forced her, if the thing was done in the Field, or in a

But the meaning of this Law is, either to forbid the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to marry with ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or not to admit them to bear any Office in the Jewiſh Commonwealth. The Hebrew Doctors gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally take it in the firſt ſenſe: See <hi>Selden de Jure Nat. &amp; Gent. Lib.</hi> V. <hi>Cap.</hi> XVI. and ſo do a great many among Chriſtian Writers. And there is an eminent Example of the uſe of this Phraſe in this ſenſe, XIII <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1, 2, 3. But ſome think it was ſuperfluous to forbid this, becauſe none would marry with ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as were uncapable to perform the Marriage Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And therefore they follow the ſecond ſenſe, it being certain that the Hebrew word KAHAL, <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> ſignifies in many places, not the whole Body
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:64710:197"/>
of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but the great Aſſembly of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, into which no ſuch Perſon was to be admitted: becauſe they were unfit for Government, <hi>Eunuchs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved generally to want Courage. Thus <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon de Muis</hi> and others, who ſeem to have great reaſon on their ſide. Yet it is ſo plain, that <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the LORD</hi> in the following part of this Chapter, ſignifies the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who might not marry with the Perſons mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 8. that I cannot but think it ought to be ſo interpreted here. For though ſuch Marriages were uſeleſs and unprofitable, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſpeaks, yet they made a diſtinction between thoſe who were made <hi>Eunuchs</hi> by God (that is born ſo) and thoſe made by Men: And this Law, they ſay, is not to be underſtood of the former, but only of the latter. Some of which, it is certain, were left in ſuch a Condition, that they were deſirous of Marriage; as appears by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Emperour <hi>Leo,</hi> who did not think it ſuperfluous to forbid Marriage with them. For it appears by it, that ſome Women choſe ſuch Husbands. See alſo XXX <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 20. but eſpecially the Book aſcribed to St. <hi>Baſil (de vera Virginitate, Tom.</hi> I. <hi>p.</hi> 782, &amp;c.) where there is too free a deſcription of the unextinguiſhable Luſt of ſuch <hi>Eunuchs</hi> as were only deprived <gap reason="foreign">

And on the other ſide, though they were unfit for Marriage, yet it appears by many Inſtances in Hiſtory, that they were not unfit for Government, nor wanted Courage for the greateſt Undertakings.

If we can think this vile Idolatry was ſo ancient as the days of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which it is certain prevailed afterward, this may paſs for a very likely reaſon, why God would not accept ſo much as the price for which a Dog was ſold, or exchanged; for ſo the LXX. expounds it: As for example, If a Man gave a Lamb for a fine Dog, God would not have that Lamb offered at his Altar; as <hi>Maimonides</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it.</p>

                  <hi>Thou mayest lend upon uſury.]</hi> Some of the <hi>Jews</hi> would have this to be an Affirmative Precept, oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to take Uſury of a Gentile, if they lent him any Money. For this <hi>Maimonides</hi> quotes a paſſage out of <hi>Siphri;</hi> which others ſay he miſtook. See <hi>J.

Only Men that ſtudied the Law, and thereby were out of danger of being inticed to their Religion, might freely lend
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:64710:207"/>
them Money upon Uſury; for this very end, as they think, that they might make a gain of it, and inrich themſelves. See <hi>Selden Lib.</hi> VI. <hi>de Jure Nat. &amp; Gent.

               <p>
                  <hi>But unto thy brother thou ſhalt not lend upon uſury.]</hi> He repeats this again, that they might not fail to be kind one to another in this matter. And the Author of <hi>Etz-Hachajim</hi> mentioned by <hi>Wagenſeil,</hi> ſaith, according to their ancient Doctors, this is ſix times forbidden in the Law, not to take Uſury of their Brethren, <hi>p.</hi> 601. upon <hi>Sota.</hi> And indeed, as there was nothing more rational than this, that their Neighbours making great gain by Merchandize (ſuch as the <hi>Sidonians, Tyrians,</hi> and thoſe that lived upon the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi>) they ſhould not borrow Money of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for nothing; ſo it was no leſs reaſonable, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> themſelves, whoſe chiefeſt Profit was by Husbandry and Breeding of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſhould have Money lent them freely by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without any Intereſt; their Land not being a Country of Traffick, whereby Money might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, as in other Countries. For by the Laws of other Nations (as <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerves on VI <hi>Luke</hi> 35.) that Uſury was odious which was practiſed upon Husbandmen. <hi>Abarbinel</hi> alſo is ſo tender in this point, as to ſay, that Uſury hath ſomething in it ſo unequal (at leaſt as it is commonly practiſed) that God did not

                  <hi>After that ſhe is defiled.]</hi> This is the reaſon why the former Husband might not marry her again (as the <hi>Jews</hi> take it) becauſe by her ſecond Marriage ſhe was defiled. Which, they ſay ſhe was, (ſo that he could not have her again) though ſhe had been only eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a new Husband, who had never lain with her. For they make no difference between her ſecond Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and ſecond Eſpouſals; but think a Woman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſuch a Pollution by her ſecond Eſpouſals, that ſhe would not have been ſo much polluted, if ſhe had
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:64710:213"/>
plaid the Whore after her Divorce. For in that caſe, they ſay, he might notwithſtanding have married her again; but not after ſhe had been married to another. Thus Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> reports their opinion, <hi>Lib.</hi> I. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xor. Hebr. Cap.</hi> XI. where he obſerves that the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who are wont in many things, to ape the <hi>Jews,</hi> here quite differ from them; allowing a Man liberty to take his Wife again, though he had divorced her three times.</p>
               <p>Now the ground upon which a divorced Woman was accounted <hi>defiled,</hi> or <hi>unclean,</hi> after another Man had married her, I ſuppoſe, was that this was lookt upon as a Solemn Renunciation of her former Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, on her part; who had been renounced by him, by the Bill of Divorce, but he was not abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by her, till ſhe married another, whereby ſhe was totally alienated from him. This made her unclean, not in her ſelf, nor with reſpect to her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Husband, whom ſhe married, nor with reſpect to any other Man, (who might marry her without any pollution) but only with reſpect to her firſt Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Unto whom, by this Law, ſhe was made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean: for ſo all things forbidden to the <hi>Jews</hi> were accounted, as appears from X <hi>Acts</hi> 14, 15. where all Meats prohibited by the Law are called <hi>unclean;</hi> and God is ſaid to have <hi>cleanſed</hi> them, by taking off that Prohibition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For that is abomination before the LORD.]</hi> That is, to return to her firſt Husband, and to be his Wife again: For this, ſaith <hi>Abarbinel,</hi> was to imitate the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who changed their Wives, and took them again into their Houſes, which was the occaſion of great filthineſs. But this intimates, that if ſhe had not been married to any other Man, but kept her ſelf
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:64710:213"/>
free, ſhe might have been his Wife again, if he had a mind to be Reconciled to her. And this ſhows al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that God intended to diſcourage them from put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away their Wives; by making them uncapable, after they had been married to another, for ever to enjoy them again, though they grew very rich, or otherwiſe deſirable: which inclined many, no doubt, to conſider well before they parted with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou ſhalt not cauſe the Land to ſin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee,</hi> &amp;c.] The People of the Land might, by ſuch a large Indulgence, have been tempted to pollute it with many ſins, and thereby bring God's Judgments upon it. See III <hi>Jerem.</hi> 1. For, as <hi>Iſaac Arama</hi> gloſſes, if this had not been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, a Gate had been opened unto vile Men, to <hi>make a trade of changing their Wives,</hi> and thereby fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Land with Whoredoms.</p>

<pb n="444" facs="tcp:64710:226"/>
the <hi>Mouth,</hi> that they ſhould always be talking of what <hi>Amalek</hi> did to them. The <hi>ſecond, Not to forget it;</hi> which he refers to their <hi>Heart:</hi> that they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let ſlip out of their mind the hatred <hi>Amalek</hi> had to them. And the <hi>third,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>blot out their remembrance from under Heaven;</hi> i. e. utterly deſtroy them, and leave none of them remaining. But none of the <hi>Jews</hi> hath explained this better than <hi>Abarbinel;</hi> who, inquiring why ſuch Severity was expreſſed againſt the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> when the <hi>Edomites,</hi> who were of the ſame Race were dealt withal very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably, (as we read before XXIII. 8.) obſerves <hi>four</hi> Reaſons given here by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, why they ſhould remember, when they were ſettled in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and able to effect it, to exterminate this Nation: For that is the ſingle Precept he gives them in charge; only he bids them not forget what <hi>Amalek</hi> had done to deſerve that heavy Sentence long ago paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon them, and remaining on Record (XVII <hi>Exod.</hi> 14, 15, 16.) confirmed with a Solemn Oath; though they were not able to execute it till they were ſettled in the Land of Promiſe. The firſt of theſe Reaſons is, Becauſe, whereas Men undertake War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others, either to defend their own Country, or to ſubdue their Enemies Country, the <hi>Amalekites</hi> came forth againſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> without any ſuch Cauſe: for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did not paſs by their Country, and conſequently gave them no apprehenſion of an Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; nor had the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> then poſſeſſion of any Land of their own, which might tempt the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites</hi> to covet it, and drive them out of it. But they undertook this War, with a petulant Malice, only to bring them into ſlavery again. Which is the thing here intimated in this Verſe, <hi>Remember what Amalek
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:64710:226"/>
did to thee,</hi> &amp;c. Unto which he ſhould have added, that their barbarity was much aggravated, by their aſſaulting them, when they were newly delivered from grievous Oppreſſions, and were unaccuſtomed to War, and without any provocation.</p>

Which he thinks is intimated in theſe words, <hi>He met thee by the way:</hi> that is, on a ſudden, by ſurprize, without any Notice by a Declaration of War. He might have added, that they did this when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in a Journey, and had travelled a great way, and in a Wilderneſs, where they ſtood in need of Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but were very unfit for fighting. Then, ſaith one of their <hi>Rabbins</hi> in <hi>Pirke Elieſer, Cap.</hi> XLIV. <hi>They came like a Bear in their way, to devour the Mother with the Children.</hi>

                  <hi>And ſmote the hindermost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary.]</hi> This he makes the <hi>third</hi> Cauſe; that they did not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them a pitcht Battle, but only fell upon their Rear (as we ſpeak) and there cut off ſuch as lagg'd behind through feebleneſs and wearineſs; being unable to march ſo faſt as the reſt of their Brethren. This is a very ſober ſenſe, ſutable to the uſe of the word in X <hi>Joſh.</hi> 19. But what ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, that the <hi>Amalekites</hi> cut off the Privy Members of certain of the Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> in deriſion of Circumciſion, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned by others of them, as having no foundation.

               <p>

Which might have made them underſtand, that he ſets up Kings, and pulls down Kings, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> ſpeaks, 2.21. But inſtead of conſidering this, they would have <hi>prophaned the Glory of the LORD</hi> (as he ſpeaks) by inſlaving thoſe whom he had but newly delivered, and continued under the protection of a glorious Cloud.

But it may be ſuppoſed, that every Man was privately to make this Solemn Profeſſion, as in the Preſence of God, who knew the truth of what he ſaid. Or rather, that the next time he went up to worſhip at God's Houſe, he was bound to make this declaration before the Divine Majeſty.

                  </q> If there was ſuch a Cuſtom in the World, when <hi>Moſes</hi> lived, it may very well be thought that he taught the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to diſclaim ſuch ſenſleſs and impious practices. And as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by this mourning acknowledged <hi>Iſis,</hi> that is the Earth, to be the giver of all theſe good things; ſo he required God's People to bring in their Harveſt with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Joy and Thanks unto the moſt High.

Others think only the Ten Commandments are here intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which were the principal <hi>words of the Covenant,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> calls this Law XXIX. 1. But <hi>Joſephus, L.</hi> IV. <hi>Archaeol. Cap. ult.</hi> is of opinion, that he means the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which here follow from <hi>v.</hi> 15. to the end of the Chapter.

               <p>But however we underſtand this, it is certain that before the uſe of Paper was found out, the Ancients, particularly the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> were wont to write their minds upon <hi>Stones,</hi> as a great many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors teſtifie mentioned by <hi>Huetius.</hi> Who obſerves
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:64710:238"/>
that this Cuſtom continued long after the Invention of Paper; eſpecially if they deſired any thing ſhould be vulgarly known and conveyed down to Poſterity. See <hi>Demonſtr. Evang.

I ſuppoſe he means all the <hi>Laws</hi> contained in this Book (not all the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations</hi> and <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> paſſages) which agrees very well with this Injunction, that they ſhould write on the ſtones, <hi>all the words of this Law.</hi>

Which place is particularly named, in the next Verſe. And from theſe words, <hi>Fortunatus Scacchus</hi> thinks he hath reaſon to aſſert, that none of the things forementioned are meant by the <hi>words of this Law,</hi> here commanded to be written: But that upon the very top of theſe <hi>Stones</hi> (or the <hi>Altar</hi> made of them, as he would have it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood) were written only the words of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whereby the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> confeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have received the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> from God, and to hold it on Condition of their Obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. For ſo he interprets the words <hi>write upon them; in ſumma ſuperficie.</hi> And to make us know what he means by <hi>the words of this Law,</hi> he thinks the following words are added, <hi>That thou mayest go in unto the Land which the LORD thy God giveth thee,</hi> &amp;c.

the Commands given to thee by God in <hi>Horeb.</hi> And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not bid them write on the Stones the <hi>Law of the LORD,</hi> nor <hi>the Law</hi> abſolutely, but the <hi>words of this Law.</hi> Where the demonſtrative Particle <hi>hazoth</hi> limits the ſenſe to the preſent Matter of which he is ſpeaking.

                  <hi>And there thou ſhalt ſerve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and ſtone.]</hi> Here that excellent Perſon I have ſo often mentioned, (Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi>) commends it to the Readers conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether this part of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Prophecy may not be underſtood of the Convert <hi>Jews</hi> throughout the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Dominions, who are often urged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Idolatry with Stocks and Stones, upon more ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical terms (if they gain-ſay) than their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers were, either by the <hi>Aſſyrians, Chaldaeans, Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Romans,</hi> or any whatſoever that led them Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive out of their Land.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, There is a great difference between the Heathen Idolatry, and the preſent Image-worſhip in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; it is granted the Idolatry is of a divers kind, and ſo it ſeems <hi>Moſes</hi> meant, when he threatens the <hi>Jews,</hi> after their final Tranſportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into theſe Weſtern Countries, <hi>ſhould ſerve ſuch gods as their fathers had not known:</hi> for their Fore-fathers, before <hi>Moſes</hi> his time and after, had known the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then gods too well; but were perfect Strangers to this Image-worſhip now in uſe. And to ſtrengthen this interpretation, it ought to be obſerved, that theſe words, <hi>which neither thou nor thy fathers have known,</hi> are omitted in the <hi>thirty ſixth</hi> Verſe of this Chapter; where he ſpeaks of their <hi>ſerving of other gods of wood and ſtone,</hi> as he doth here. But that part of the Prophecy belongs to what they did in the firſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity into <hi>Babylon,</hi> as <hi>Manaſſeh ben Iſrael</hi> obſerves.

That Expulſion out of <hi>Alexandria</hi> is mentioned by <hi>David Ganz</hi> alſo, one of their own Authors.

The Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle was ſo horrible, that it quite aſtoniſhed the reſt of this wretched People; two thouſand of which periſhed in this barbarous manner.

how little worth theſe vile Wretches were, as it here follows. In after times, I have obſerved in the courſe of this <hi>Commentary,</hi> how they were ſold for Slaves in ſome places, and in all uſed as no better. <hi>Benjamin Tudelenſis,</hi> who went a Pilgrimage to viſit his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, repreſents their Condition as moſt miſerable throughout the Eaſtern Empire. And particularly complains of their hard uſage among the <hi>Greeks</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Within the Walls of which City they were not ſuffered to live, nor to come thither, but on occaſion of Traffick and Buſineſs; and that only by Boat, (for they had their Habitation in a kind of an Iſland) not a Man being permitted on Horsback, except only one <hi>Solyman</hi> the Emperour's Phyſician. Whoſe advancement was their ſole Comfort in that miſerable Servitude under which the reſt groaned, without any difference of good or bad, (as he acknowledges) who were daily beaten and abuſed in the open Streets. Thus he confeſſes, though his principal deſign was to ſet forth the power they retained in the world. <hi>Iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerarium, p.</hi> 27, 28. <hi>Edit. L'Empereur.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And no man ſhall buy you.]</hi> Though ſome, as I ſaid before, were ſold at a very vile rate, next to nothing; yet others hung upon the Sellers hands, (as we ſpeak) the Market being either ſo overſtockt with their numbers, that none would cheapen the greateſt part of them; or they were ſo contemptible that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy would give what was askt for ſuch uſeleſs Slaves. For as no Money could purchaſe their Peace and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity from Calamities, ſo neither could their Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, though continually moſt grievous, (they are the words of Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi>) redeem their eſtimation in the world; nor all the Blood of their Slain (tho' their Maſſacres were numberleſs) extinguiſh that hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:64710:275"/>
and loathſome Conceit, which moſt Men had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of them. For in the <hi>fifteenth Century</hi> they were become ſo abominable, that ſeveral <hi>Doctors</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to hold it unlawful for Chriſtians to let them live among them. Particularly the famous <hi>Thomas Turrecremata,</hi> Inquiſitor General, forbad all Men to have any dealings with them, or to afford them Meat, or Drink, or any thing elſe. Whence proceeded the direful Proſcriptions which we read of in that Age, whereby they were forced out of <hi>Spain, Poland, Hungary,</hi> and divers other Countries; where they were not ſuffered to live, though with a Note and Character upon them, to diſtinguiſh them from all other Men.</p>
               <p>I conclude my Obſervations on this Chapter, with the Remark which the ſame great Man (Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi>) makes, <hi>Chapt.</hi> XXII. <hi>Paragr.</hi> 6. That the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Bleſſings and Plagues which were to overtake this People, being here ſet down by <hi>Moſes;</hi> although their Bleſſings might have been more, and more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than the Curſes that have befaln them; yet he either foreſeeing, or fearing <hi>what would be,</hi> rather than hoping <hi>the best that might be,</hi> is almoſt <hi>four</hi> times as long in enumerating their Plagues, as he is in their Bleſſings. And ſo have the Miſeries of the latter <hi>Jews</hi> been <hi>four</hi> times as long, as the Proſperity of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Anceſtors. And ſince our Saviour's Death, all the Plagues which were in part fulfilled before, have been more than <hi>ſeven times</hi> multiplied upon them. For in their former Overthrows or Captivities, though they ſuffered the Violence of War, yet after that Storm was paſt, ſo they did but ſubmit to their Conquerers, they lived well enough, nay uſually found more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary favour at their hands: But ſince our Saviour's Death, they have through all Ages been more and

               <p>

XI. 3, 4.) and makes it a great aggravation of their guilt, if they ſhould forſake him, who had done ſuch wonderful things for them, XIII. 5, 10.

Which muſt not be imputed to any want of power in theſe things to move them; much leſs of the Divine Grace to work upon their hearts by them; but was wholly to be aſcribed to their own negligence and perverſneſs.

them to enter into this Covenant; and to ſhow them the neceſſity of renewing it.

theſe words to be meant of the puniſhment of ſecret ſins (particularly of Idolatry ſpoken of before <hi>v.</hi> 19.) which belongeth unto God, as the puniſhment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſins belonged unto them, in obedience to his Law; who commanded them to put to death him that ſeduced any Perſon to Idolatry, and to raze the City that apoſtatized unto it, XIII. 5, 6, &amp;c. 12, 13, &amp;c. And their negligence in doing their duty in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, made Idolatry ſpread among them to their utter ruin. But theſe words may be underſtood as a further anſwer to ſuch Enquiries, as that <hi>v.</hi> 24. In which if Men perſiſted, and ſtill askt, But why doth God thus puniſh his own People, with ſuch unuſual Severity, when there are many Idolatrous Nations far worſe than they, who continue ſtill in their own Land, and are not thus rooted out? <hi>Moſes</hi> bids them ſilence ſuch Demands, and reſt ſatisfied in this; that we cannot give an account of ſuch things, as God hath not revealed; particularly, why he puniſhes ſome People, when he ſpares others who are as bad; but muſt mind our own duty, which he hath plainly revealed unto us. That is, (as <hi>Moſes</hi> concludes this Chapter) <hi>to do after all his Commandments which he hath given us in his Law;</hi> believing he will greatly reward the obedient, and terribly puniſh, one time or other, all thoſe that tranſgreſs it.</p>
               <p>There may be alſo a more obvious ſenſe of theſe words, if we tranſlate them as ſome great Men have done, <hi>The ſecrets of the LORD our God, are revealed to us and to our Children.</hi> Thus <hi>Onkelos,</hi> whoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is very valuable; which <hi>Grotius</hi> follows, and before him <hi>Forſterus;</hi> and <hi>Paulus Fagius</hi> repreſents it as a commodious ſenſe; and makes it the ſame with the words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> CXLVII. 20. <hi>He hath not

But this made them lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be puniſhed more grievouſly than all other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if they did not obſerve his Will which he moſt graciouſly diſcovered to them.

And therefore ſaith, theſe words of <hi>Moſes</hi> can by no means be thought to be fulfilled, when the Tribes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> returned from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and left a vaſt number behind them, who would not come back with them, but ſtay there to this day.</p>

<pb n="582" facs="tcp:64710:295"/>
moſt of theſe Five Books ſome time ago, (and ſo the foregoing words may be tranſlated, <hi>Moſes had wrote this Law</hi>) but did not finiſh them till a little before his death, and then delivered them to the Prieſts. But there is no neceſſity thus to underſtand it; for he might have had time enough between this and his death, to write the whole <hi>Pentateuch:</hi> It being only ſaid (<hi>v.</hi> 14.) <hi>Thy days approach that thou must die,</hi> which doth not imply he was to die in a day or two, but there might be ſome weeks before his departure.</p>

The <hi>Kohathites,</hi> who were mere <hi>Levites</hi> and not Prieſts, did carry the Ark in their Travels through the Wilderneſs, after the Prieſts had covered it, and put in the Staves thereof, (as I have ſhown IV <hi>Numb.</hi> 5, 6, &amp;c.) but it is evident they ſerved only as Miniſters to the Prieſts, who, upon great occaſions, bare the Ark themſelves. As when they paſſed over <hi>Jordan</hi> (III <hi>Joſh.</hi> 3, 6.) when they compaſſed <hi>Jericho,</hi> (VI <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6.) and when the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Solomon</hi> was dedicated, and the Ark brought into it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> VIII. 3, 4, 6.

                  <hi>Thou ſhalt read this Law before all Iſrael, in their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.]</hi> This Order being directed, not to all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but to a particular Perſon, plainly imports, that the <hi>Supream Governour,</hi> whoſoever he was, had this charge
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:64710:296"/>
laid upon him, to take care theſe Laws ſhould be read at this Solemn Time, that all the People might hear them. And therefore, I think, the <hi>Jews</hi> rightly ſay, that their Kings, when they had them, were bound not only to look after this matter, but to read the Law themſelves, to as many (that is) as could hear them; appointing the Prieſts and the <hi>Levites</hi> to read it in as many other Aſſemblies of the People, as were neceſſary for the fulfilling of this Precept. In order to which, a Pulpit was ſet up in the Court of the Men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> on the very firſt day of the Feaſt, (for they did not think fit to defer it till the laſt, becauſe it is here ſaid, <hi>when Iſrael is come to appear before the LORD,</hi> not when they were ready to depart, as the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerve) the King going up into it, the Miniſter took the Book of the Law, and delivered it to the Ruler of the Synagogue, who gave it to the <hi>Sagan</hi> (or Vicar of the High Prieſt) who delivered it to the High Prieſt, and he to the King; who ſtood up to receive it, and then ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t down to read. All this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the reverence with which this holy Book was delivered; and likewiſe the reverence with which they approached to the King. Who, they ſay, began to read at this Book of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> (which is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium of the Law) and proceeded, before he ſtopt, to thoſe words, VI. 4. <hi>Hear, O Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo read, he omitted the reſt till he came to <hi>Chap.</hi> XI. 13. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, if thou wilt hearken diligently,</hi> &amp;c. reading on to the 22d <hi>Verſe.</hi> And then skipt to XIV. 22. <hi>And thou ſhalt truly tithe,</hi> &amp;c. reading on to the Section concerning the King, XVII. 14. and then the Curſings and Bleſſings out of the XXVIIth and XXVIIIth <hi>Chapter,</hi> till he had ended all that Section of the Law.

And as their chief Learning did conſiſt of Poetry, ſo the excellency of their Poetry was ſeen in the proper and native Subject of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; that is, in Matters of ſacred uſe or obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. From whence the Title of <hi>Vates</hi> deſcended unto Secular and Prophane Poets, who detained the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Speech uſed by the former. But, as <hi>Conradus Pellicanus</hi> here truly obſerves, (and ſee my Notes on XV <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.) the Scripture Poetry doth not conſiſt in the cadency and number of Syllables contrived to pleaſe the ear; but in brief and weighty Sentences, ſimply and ſincerely compoſed, in a lively manner, to enlighten the Underſtandings, move the Affections, and ſtick in the Memory. And the Ancients (as a great Man of our own obſerves) had this advantage of later Poets, <q>That the Faſhion of the World (as he ſpeaks) in their times, was more apt to raviſh their thoughts with admiration; wonderful Events being then more frequent, and their frequency not abating, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſing their wonderment, becauſe their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety was very great, and the apprehenſion of invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, or ſupernatural Powers in thoſe Events was uſual and undoubted. So that admiration was then inforced upon Men, and the Breaſts of thoſe
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:64710:304"/>
who diligently obſerved thoſe Events, or were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way diſpoſed by Nature to it, were inſpired with lively and ſublime Affections, apt to vent themſelves in ſuch Poetical Phraſe and Reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as we cannot reach; unleſs we raiſe our Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Imitation, and ſtir up Admiration by Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Study.

But I think there is a more ſimple ſenſe may be given of theſe words, than any of the forementioned, only by ſuppoſing

the Particle <hi>Lamed</hi> to be omitted, (as in many other places) before <hi>paroth.</hi> Which is this, <hi>from the King, to the Slave of the Enemies.</hi> For they were wont to ſhave their Captives, as every one knows, by way of Contempt and Scorn. Which is the reaſon God threatens <hi>baldneſs</hi> ſo often to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, when he was ſo angry with them, that he gave them up to be Slaves.

                  </gap>, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him,</hi> are the very words of the Apoſtle, I <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. which ſeem to have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from hence out of the LXX. for they are no where elſe to be found in the Scripture. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin indeed of our Bibles refers us to XCVII <hi>Pſalm</hi> 7. But there the words of the LXX. are otherwiſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Worſhip him all ye his Angels.</hi> Which are in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Perſon: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as here, and in the Apoſtle, the words are in the <hi>third.</hi> We may therefore ſuppoſe rather, that the LXX. from ancient Tradition among the <hi>Jews,</hi> added theſe words (before they tranſlated this Verſe) to declare unto what time the fulfilling of them ſhould principally belong. For the XCVII <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſeems to be but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcant (as Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi>'s words are) upon this part of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Song; from whence the <hi>Jews</hi> might learn the Scope of it. And accordingly the Apoſtle uſes the words of the LXX. here in this place, rather than thoſe of the <hi>Pſalmist;</hi> becauſe he would have the <hi>Hebrews</hi> underſtand and conſider, that <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf had predicted the Exaltation of the Son of God, as the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> afterwards expounded him.</p>
               <p>There is another Tranſlation of theſe words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which is very agreeable to the Apoſtle in XV <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>Rejoyce ye Nations, who are his People.</hi> See <hi>v.</hi> 21. of this Chapter. Either way, this is a plain Prophecy of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> becoming one Body with the People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And thus <hi>Kimchi</hi> himſelf tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates it, <hi>Sing ye Gentiles, who are his People:</hi> which began to be fulfilled after our Saviour's Aſcenſion to the Throne of his Glory in the Heavens, when all the Angels of God worſhipped him. Hitherto <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſuppoſed, in this Song, great Enmity between them:
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:64710:322"/>
and that ſometimes they had plagued <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſorely; as at others God rendred to them according to what they had done unto his People. But now he breaks out into a rapture of Joy, to think that they ſhould one day be reconciled, and made one People of God. And the LXX. thus underſtanding it, might well preface to their Tranſlation of this Verſe, with the words now mentioned, <hi>Rejoyce ye Heavens together with him.</hi> For if there be joy in Heaven, as <hi>Procopius Gazaeus</hi> well gloſſes, at the Repentance of one Sinner, how much more for the Salvation of the whole World, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the Devil's Tyranny. Which being to be performed by the Advancement of the Son of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Heavens, the next words might well be added, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi> Which they had always done (the ſame <hi>Procopius</hi> obſerves) as their God who created them: but now they Praiſe and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol his Humanity, exalted at the right Hand of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For he will avenge the blood of his Servants.]</hi> Theſe words ſeem to expreſs ſome of the Motives that ſhould perſwade the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to become one Body with the <hi>Jews,</hi> (for ſuch the Apoſtles, and all the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts were) God's puniſhing all thoſe who ſhed the Blood of his <hi>Servants;</hi> as the Chriſtian <hi>Martyrs</hi> are called in the Book of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> In which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence the LXX. add another Sentence before theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="638" facs="tcp:64710:323"/>
perſecuted all thoſe who embraced Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And will be merciful unto his Land.]</hi> This cannot be meant of the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was no longer God's Land than any other, but of the whole Earth, (as <hi>Conrad. Pellicanus</hi> well explains it) in which that one People of God dwells; reduced (as he ſpeaks) in the whole Multitude of the Faithful into one Catholick Church. For they all acknowledge, from the greateſt to the leaſt, that One only Omnipotent God, with no leſs Devotion and Affection, than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaac, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And unto his People.]</hi> The whole World that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, and are his faithful Servants; whoſe Blood he will avenge, XIX <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. and then ſet up his Tabernacle with Men, and dwell with them, and they ſhall be his People, and he will be their God, XX <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. which I mention, becauſe this part of the Prophecy reaches unto the laſt times, and is not yet all fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Thus this famous Song concludes, which as the <hi>Jews</hi> reckon, conſiſts of Seventy Verſes, each of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains two diſtinct and entire Sentences: and, as they fancy, are a Compendium of the whole Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Nay, ſome of them (ſuch are the idle Conceits of this Nation) think this Hymn is ſo perfect a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, that it contains in it the Names of all the Men in the World; which they undertake to find, and by that Verſicle where it is, to tell what Fortune he, whoſe Name they ſeek, ſhall have in the World. Thus, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of obſerving ſeriouſly what <hi>Moſes</hi> foretold would certainly befal themſelves; their Superſtition and hardneſs of heart have led them to vain Conjectures concerning other Men.

                  <hi>And roſe up from Seir unto them, and ſhone forth from Mount Paran.]</hi> There is no difficulty in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, it being evident that God came down on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and thence delivered his Commands to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and eſpouſed them for his People. But how he roſe up from <hi>Seir</hi> unto them, the Country of <hi>Edom;</hi> and ſhone from <hi>Paran</hi> the Country of <hi>Iſhma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> is not ſo eaſie to underſtand. The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed, who are wont to ſolve all Difficulties, by inventing what they pleaſe, are not troubled to give an account of theſe words. Which ſignifie, they fancy, that the Divine Glory firſt reſided upon Mount <hi>Seir,</hi> where God propounded his Law to the Children of <hi>Eſau;</hi> but they would not have it, becauſe they found theſe words in it, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> He went therefore to
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:64710:326"/>
                  <hi>Paran,</hi> and offered it to the Children of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> but they refuſed it alſo, becauſe they found theſe words in it, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Steal.</hi> So he came to <hi>Sinai,</hi> and gave it to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>All the words which the LORD hath ſaid, will we do,</hi> XXIV <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. Thus the <hi>Hieruſalem Targum,</hi> and <hi>Pirke Elieſer,</hi> and ſome other more ancient Authors, with this addition, That he offered the Law to all the Nations of the World, but they rejected it, becauſe it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt have none other gods but me.</hi> But this looks ſo like a Fable, that ſome of themſelves are aſhamed of it, and have given a better ſenſe of the words, though I cannot ſay the true one. For thus <hi>Abraham Peritſol</hi> expounds them, <hi>The true Law came out of</hi> Sinai <hi>to the</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>by which the</hi> Edomites <hi>were ſo inlightned, that God might be ſaid to riſe up to them alſo: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Celeſtial Influence ſhone out of this Law to the</hi> Iſhmaelites, <hi>who were the better for it.</hi> Thus <hi>Conſt. L'Empereur</hi> reports his ſenſe in his <hi>Annotations</hi> upon <hi>Bava kama, Cap.</hi> IV. <hi>Sect.</hi> III. where he endeavours to make out a plainer ſenſe of theſe words, in this manner: Though the Mountain of <hi>Paran</hi> was nigher to <hi>Sinai</hi> than <hi>Seir</hi> was, and firſt occurred to thoſe that went out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> yet there was great reaſon to mention <hi>Seir</hi> before it, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> had reſpect to the order of their Journeys, and not to the Site of the Places. And their Journeys were ſo directed by Divine Providence, that fetching a long Circuit, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and backward, they ſhould come to <hi>Canaan.</hi> In all which turnings and windings they were marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly preſerved and provided for, by the ſame good Providence which conducted them. Of this <hi>Moſes</hi> here makes a thankful Commemoration, how he led them from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to the Borders of the Land of
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:64710:327"/>
                  <hi>Canaan,</hi> towards Mount <hi>Seir,</hi> as is expreſly noted by <hi>Moſes,</hi> (compare I <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. with II. 1. and XX <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.) From whence, by reaſon of their Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, they were led back again towards the Red Sea; and incamped in the extremity of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, XXXIII <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. where <hi>Ptolemy</hi> places <hi>Paran,</hi> (though there was another part of it called <hi>Paran</hi> near <hi>Kadeſh,</hi> XIII <hi>Numb.</hi> 3, 27.) And from thence they were led back again in a long Circuit, to the Eaſt part of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> This may be one reaſon why theſe two places are mentioned together with <hi>Sinai,</hi> that God, who there appeared to them, was with them all the time they wandred about in the Wilderneſs, till he brought them to the Borders of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where they now were. And another may be, becauſe in Mount <hi>Seir</hi> the brazen Serpent was erected by God's order, for the Cure of ſuch as were bitten by Serpents, when they looked on it: which was an illuſtrious Type of our bleſſed Saviour, and the Salvation wrought by him, XX <hi>Numb.</hi> 4, 9. And in the Deſert to which <hi>Paran</hi> gave the name, (becauſe it overlookt the whole, though very large) they received the joyful news, that they ſhould march into <hi>Canaan:</hi> or, as <hi>D. Chytraeus</hi> underſtands it, in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Paran</hi> the LXX Elders received the Spirit, to make them Aſſiſtants unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Government, (X <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. XI. 24, &amp;c.) and here, I may add, <hi>Moſes</hi> repeated his Law to them, I <hi>Deut.</hi> 1, 5. who ſeems in this Verſe to follow a Metaphor borrowed from the Sun; which firſt illuminates the Air; and then riſes, and then ſpreads abroad his Beams; as God by degrees declared his Preſence with his People whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they went; firſt at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> then at <hi>Seir,</hi> and laſt of all here in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Paran.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="647" facs="tcp:64710:327"/>But it muſt be acknowledged that theſe words may be interpreted in a more ſimple manner; they being but a further amplification of what was ſaid in the firſt words, <hi>the LORD came from Sinai.</hi> When at the ſame time he <hi>roſe up from Seir,</hi> and <hi>ſhone forth from</hi> Mount <hi>Paran:</hi> for theſe Mountains were very near one to another; or rather parts of one and the ſame ridge of Mountains, as <hi>Conr. Pellicanus</hi> here obſerves; and is more clearly made out by a very Learned Man among our ſelves (Dr. <hi>Hyde,</hi> in his excellent Notes on <hi>Abrah. Peritſol, Itinera Mundi, p.</hi> 73.) for <hi>Teman</hi> (which is the ſame with <hi>Paran,</hi> III <hi>Habak.</hi> 3.) was near to <hi>Edom,</hi> whoſe chief City was <hi>Boſra,</hi> I <hi>Amos</hi> 12. as that was near to <hi>Sinai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ignorance of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> is much to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, who out of this place imagine they have found as good an Authority for the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as there is for the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and for the Goſpel of Chriſt. For thus they interpret theſe words, <hi>God gave the Law from Sinai, and the Goſpel from Seir,</hi> (which they would have to be the ſame with <hi>Galilee,</hi> which our Saviour much frequented) <hi>and the Alcoran from Mount Paran.</hi> Which they fancy is a Mountain not far from <hi>Mecca.</hi> See Dr. <hi>Pocock</hi> upon <hi>Greg. Abul Pharaji p.</hi> 183. and <hi>Guadagnolus Reſp. pro Relig. Chriſtiana.</hi> But the laſt words of this Verſe, <hi>for them,</hi> are ſufficient to confute theſe Conceits; for they plainly ſhow that the whole Verſe ſpeaks of the People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And he came with ten thouſand of Saints.]</hi> Or, as our Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> thinks it ſhould be tranſlated, <hi>with his holy ten thouſands,</hi> or <hi>myriads:</hi> that is, attended with an innumerable company of Angels, who waited on him at the giving of the Law. See LXVIII <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7. VII <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. of which <hi>Enoch</hi> perhaps prophecied in part,
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:64710:328"/>
                  <hi>Jude</hi> 14, 15. And from hence it may be thought, that Notion of the Jewiſh Doctors, followed by St. <hi>Stephen</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that the Law was given by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, had its beginning, <hi>Mede, Book</hi> II. <hi>p.</hi> 437. That is, they attended upon God, as his Miniſters, when he himſelf gave the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From his right hand.]</hi> With which we are wont to deliver things to other Perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Went a fiery Law for them.]</hi> For the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was given out of the midſt of Fire, and therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a fire of Law,</hi> as the words are in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> XIX <hi>Exod.</hi> 16, 18. IV <hi>Deut.</hi> 11, 12. V. 22, 23, 24. The <hi>Cabbaliſts</hi> (as <hi>Reuchlin</hi> obſerves) fancy that God wrote the Law in a Globe of Fire, and ſent it to them. But the <hi>Hieruſalem Targum</hi> is more ſober, which thus expounds it, <hi>He ſtretched his right hand out of the midſt of flames of fire, and gave the Law unto his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And <hi>Onkelos</hi> ſtill better, <hi>The Law written with his right hand he gave us out of the midſt of fire.</hi> Or, as <hi>Campeg. Vitringa</hi> would have this latter part of the Verſe tranſlated, <hi>On his right hand a fire, and out of the fire a Law for them.</hi> The meaning being, that God came to Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> with that fire: for in Scripture, to be <hi>on the right hand</hi> of any one, is to accompany him, <hi>Lib.</hi> II. <hi>Obſerv. Sacr. Cap.</hi> IV.</p>
               <p>By the concluſion of this Verſe, it is apparent that the former part of it belongs intirely to God's Mercy unto the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> upon whom he beſtowed his Law, in moſt illuſtrious Tokens of his Preſence. Which makes it highly probable that his <hi>riſing up from Seir upon them,</hi> and <hi>ſhining from Mount Paran,</hi> belongs to the ſame matter. That is, the Cloud wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended on <hi>Sinai,</hi> with a vaſt Hoſt of Angels, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf ſo far, as to cover the neighbouring Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:64710:328"/>
of <hi>Seir</hi> and <hi>Paran.</hi> Though the meaning may be, as I have ſhown, that he continued his Preſence with them after they went from <hi>Sinai,</hi> through all their Journeys in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Seir</hi> and <hi>Paran,</hi> till they came to the place where they now were.</p>

                  <hi>And they ſat down at thy feet.]</hi> The firſt word (which we tranſlate <hi>ſat down)</hi> being no where elſe found but here, and I <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. where it plainly hath another ſenſe, hath occaſioned various Interpretations of this Sentence.

<pb n="650" facs="tcp:64710:329"/>
but ſtood at the foot of the Mount, XX <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. Therefore <hi>Onkelos</hi> underſtands this of their ſitting down, or pitching their Tents, where the glorious Cloud that led them reſted, X <hi>Numb.</hi> 12, 33.</p>

                  <hi>Every one ſhall receive of thy word.]</hi> This ſtill is commonly referred to the Peoples receiving the Law.

For ſo he interprets it; <hi>They went forward according to thy word.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Hieruſalem Targum</hi> expounds theſe and the foregoing words: <hi>Behold, they were led and came to the foot of his Cloud, and went forward and reſted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the command of his word.</hi> It takes in alſo the other ſenſe of the word <hi>tucchu</hi> (as it ſignifies <hi>ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> in I <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.) in this manner, <hi>Though he inflicted many Chaſtiſements upon them, yet they did not ceaſe, nor deſiſt from the Doctrine of the Law.</hi>

And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here it ſignifies, that the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhould have Royal Authority eſtabliſhed in it. For he doth not compare the Perſon of <hi>Joſeph</hi> to a young Bullock (though he was a goodly Man, eminent for his Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and comely Proportions, XXXIX <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.) but the Tribes which ſprang from him; as appears from the laſt words of this Verſe. Whoſe glory he here comparing to that of a young Bullock, and its glory conſiſting in its ſtrength, the power of the Tribes of <hi>Joſeph</hi> is hereby denoted; which was ſo great, that they were the chief Support of the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Which began in <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who was King of <hi>ten</hi> Tribes: after whom there followed a long Race of Kings till the Captivity. There may be alſo ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in theſe words unto <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the firſt Governour of all the People, who was of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim;</hi> as of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> were <hi>Jair, Jephthah,</hi> and <hi>Gideon,</hi> who were famous Men among the <hi>Judges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is remarkable alſo here, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> is compared to the <hi>Firſtling</hi> of a Bullock; becauſe <hi>Reuben</hi> being ſet aſide for his Inceſt, <hi>Joſeph</hi> had the Right of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture, in part, tranſlated unto him, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> V. 1, 2. and in conſequence of it, had a double Portion in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="663" facs="tcp:64710:335"/>It is to be noted likewiſe, that he is ſaid to be like unto the Firſtling of <hi>his</hi> Bullock; becauſe there were not more goodly Bullocks any where, than in <hi>Baſhan</hi> (IV <hi>Amos</hi> 1.) which fell to the ſhare of ſome of the Children of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> XVII <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.</p>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicorn</hi> (as we tranſlate the word <hi>Reem)</hi> is a very ſtrong, as well as ſtately Creature. But <hi>Bochartus</hi> hath alledged a great many things to prove that <hi>Reem</hi> is a ſort of wild Goat in <hi>Arabia,</hi> as big as a Deer, and of the ſame colour; which they now call <hi>Gazellus, P.</hi> I. <hi>Hierozoicon Lib.</hi> III. <hi>Cap.</hi> XXVII. There were ſome of them ſent lately to the French King, by the <hi>Divan</hi> of <hi>Tripoli;</hi> which had black Horns, in ſhape like thoſe of a Goat; only they were round and pointed. But the tallneſs, ſtrength, and ſwiftneſs of this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, together with its fierce, untameable Nature, hath made <hi>Ludolphus</hi> (who at firſt was of <hi>Bochart</hi>'s opinion) to conclude, upon ſecond thoughts, that <hi>Reem</hi> in Scripture ſignifies the <hi>Rhinoceros,</hi> as the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latin</hi> here tranſlates the word. See <hi>Lib.</hi> I. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentar. in Hiſtor. Aethiop. Cap.</hi> X. <hi>N.</hi> 74. Which ſeems not ſo well to agree with theſe words of <hi>Moſes;</hi> which ſuppoſe the Creature here ſpoken of to have two Horns, (he uſing the Plural Number) with which
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:64710:336"/>
the two Tribes deſcended from <hi>Joſeph</hi> are very fitly compared. And ſo <hi>David</hi> mentions the <hi>Horns</hi> of the <hi>Reem,</hi> XXII <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.

Though they were near Neighbours to <hi>Zebulun,</hi> and for that reaſon, as well as becauſe they were Brethren by the ſame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are here put both together in one Benediction.

But ſome of the <hi>Jews,</hi> not ſatisfied with this, have far-fetch'd Conceits, concerning the Death of <hi>Moſes,</hi> from theſe words. For becauſe it is ſaid, he died, <hi>al pi,</hi> at the mouth (as the words are literally in the

But this is not the meaning of the Phraſe: though no doubt <hi>Moſes</hi> departed this Life in a moſt delectable ſenſe and taſte of the Divine Love; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no unwillingneſs to die, nor being ſurpriſed with death; for he knew the time, and the place, and the manner of it. And as he did not die of any Diſeaſe, (as was ſaid before) or of old Age, or by external force; but only by the will and pleaſure of God, who took his Soul out of his Body: ſo he did not part with it againſt his will, nor with any fear; but with a placid Mind, and compoſed Spirit, committed himſelf to God. In whoſe embraces (as we may ſpeak) he expired; and this it is likely the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> meant, when they ſaid, <hi>His Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with a kiſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the time of his death, the Scripture doth not mention the Year, the Month, and the Day: but the <hi>Jews</hi> commonly place it in the laſt Month of the <hi>fortieth</hi> year after their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> called <hi>ADAR,</hi> and the <hi>ſeventh</hi> day of that Month.

<pb n="692" facs="tcp:64710:350"/>
to God, and to hear God ſpeaking in like manner unto him. And ſo the <hi>Hieruſalem Targum</hi> expounds theſe words; only inſtead of the LORD, he ſaith, <hi>Who knew the WORD of the LORD talking with him;</hi> and delivering to him moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Laws, for the good government of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
